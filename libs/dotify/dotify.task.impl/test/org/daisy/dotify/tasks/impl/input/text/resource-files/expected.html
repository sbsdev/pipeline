<p>Digitization is rapidly changing the scene for publishing, distribution and accessibility. Within a short span of time the overall framework for intellectual rights, pricing and accessibility has been challenged and new perspectives emerge for right holders, user groups, manufacturers and other stakeholders.</p>
<p>&#x00A0;</p>
<p>The Future Publishing and Accessibility conference will highlight and encourage conversations surrounding the perspectives for the future of publishing and accessibility. Come and participate in discussions on the following topics:</p>
<p>Will the role of publishing companies, manufacturers and libraries change dramatically?</p>
<p>Who will be the dominating players in the future?</p>
<p>What will be the socio-economic and commercial consequences?</p>
<p>&#x00A0;</p>
<p>You will be inspired to lead change in your own organization as we analyze these questions and highlight the practical and actionable solutions. We strive to build bridges between re-publishers of content, mainstream publishers, technology companies and libraries.</p>
<p>&#x00A0;</p>
<p>The conference features three content tracks targeting the users, the technology and new business models. All keynote sessions will offer a unique chance to meet the worldâ€™s leading practitioners and theorists. Our goal is to equip conference attendees with a road map for the future and opportunities to debate what it will take to act proactively in their respective organizations.</p>
<p>Join us and enhance your skill set to position you and your organization in the forefront of developments.</p>
