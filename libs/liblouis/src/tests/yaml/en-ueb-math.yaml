# When there are spaces within arithmetic equations, such as "12 + 2 =
# 14", the resulting UEB appears correct, with a numeric indicator
# before each number sequence. However, if there are no spaces around
# the operators, then the numeric indicator is not consistently
# applied.

# It appears that the numeric indicator is showing up correctly for
# the plus sign and equals symbol, but not for the minus sign,
# multiplication sign, or division sign.

# see https://github.com/liblouis/liblouis/issues/141
tests:
  - ['12 + 2 = 14', '#ab "6 #b "7 #ad']
  # I'm not sure if the following test case is correct. Why is it
  # expecting no space after the #ab?
  - ['12 - 2 = 10', '#ab-#b "7 #aj', {xfail: true}] 
  - ['12 * 2 = 24', '#ab "9 #b "7 #bd']
  - ['12 / 2 = 6', '#ab _/ #b "7 #f']
  - ['12+2=24', '#ab"6#b"7#bd']
  - ['12-2=10', '#ab-#b"7#aj']
  - ['12*2=24', '#ab"9#b"7#bd']
  - ['12/2=6', '#ab_/#b"7#f']
