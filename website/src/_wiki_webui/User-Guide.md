## Job View

You can access this page through the "Jobs" menu item in the navigation bar at the top of the page.

<table role="presentation">
<tr><td><p>A new job will either be "Running" or "Queued". The Pipeline 2 engine will by default allow at most two jobs to run at the same time. If you create more jobs, those jobs will be queued.</p>

<p>If the job succeeds, the status will change to "Success".</p>
<p>If there is a validation error, the status will change to "Validation failed".</p>
<p>If an error occurs during transformation, the status will change to "Failed".</p></td><td><img src="images/18.png" alt=""/></td></tr>
<tr><td><p>When a job completes without errors, the results from jobs can be downloaded through download links that appear under the "Success" state.</p></td><td><img src="images/21.png" alt=""/></td></tr>
<tr><td>Just below the "Job Summary" headline, you can click "Show details" to get more technical info about the job, such as its ID, and when it was started.</td><td><img src="images/20.png" alt=""/></td></tr>
<tr><td><p>Further down the page, there may be a validation report, or another type of report depending on which script the job were running.</p></td><td><img src="images/36.png" alt=""/></td></tr>
<tr><td><p>You can check the execution log to see what kind of tasks the job has performed. This is especially useful when a job fails so that you can determine why it failed.</p>
<p>A link is also provided to a more detailed log. The detailed log is a text file with more technical information. If you encounter a problem while executing job and want to ask for help (for instance on the DAISY Pipeline 2 forum), you should ideally attach the detailed log and if possible also the input fileset and arguments used.</p></td><td><img src="images/19.png" alt=""/></td></tr>
<tr><td><p>At the end, there are links to download the input files, and a list of what parameters were used to run the job. There are also shortcuts for restarting the job, and for creating a new job with the same inputs and parameters.</p></td><td><img src="images/34.png" alt=""/></td></tr>
