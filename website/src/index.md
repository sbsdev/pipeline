# DAISY Pipeline 2

The DAISY Pipeline is an open-source, cross-platform framework for the
migration of digital content to various formats. It intends to
facilitate the production and maintenance of accessible content for
people with print disabilities.

## Accessibility

The Pipeline was developed by and for the
[DAISY community](http://www.daisy.org/), a group of organizations
committed to making content accessible. It goes without saying that
accessiblity is the main interest of the tool. There are Pipeline
transformation for migrating from one accessible format to another,
enriching an input format with certain accessible features, and
producing formats targeting a specific disability.

## Standards

Accessibility goes hand in hand with standards. The formats that the
Pipeline primarily focuses on are [EPUB 3](http://idpf.org/epub/301),
[DAISY](http://www.daisy.org/specifications) and
[PEF](http://pef-format.org/?page_id=15).

## Background

The DAISY Pipeline is a collaborative project maintained by the
[DAISY Consortium](http://www.daisy.org/), with numerous organizations
participating and contributing to the development. The DAISY Pipeline
2 project is the follow-up of the
[DAISY Pipeline 1](http://www.daisy.org/pipeline) project. It consists
mostly in preparing for the future by redesigning the core Pipeline
framework to embrace new technologies and standards and better
integrate with the DAISY community and publishing mainstream.
