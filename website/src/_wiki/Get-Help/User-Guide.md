# User Guide

DAISY Pipeline 2 is an umbrella term for various things.

First, DAISY Pipeline 2 is an ordinary
[desktop application](https://github.com/daisy/pipeline-gui/wiki/DAISY-Pipeline-2-User-Guide/).

But DAISY Pipeline 2 is also a
[web application](https://github.com/daisy/pipeline-webui/wiki/User-Guide/). This
means that, unlike with the desktop application, multiple users can
work together in the same application, each through their own web
browser, while the real work happens on a central server. The web
application offers some additional features that are not available in
the desktop application yet, such as
"[templates](https://github.com/daisy/pipeline-webui/wiki/Templating/)".

Last but not least, DAISY Pipeline 2 can also be run as a
[service](Pipeline-as-Service) to which client programs can connect,
through a web API. In fact, the DAISY Pipeline 2 web application is an
example of such a server-client configuration. There is also a
[command line tool](Command-Line).

DAISY Pipeline 2, in all its forms, is supported on Windows, Mac OS,
and Linux.
