# Command Line Tool

The command line is not a standalone tool. It only works in
combination with a running [Pipeline server](Pipeline-as-Service). The
server may be running on the same computer or a different one. See
[Configuration](#configuration) for how to specify the address of the
server.

## Installation

Choose a package from the
[downloads page](http://daisy.github.io/pipeline//Download.html) that
includes the command line tool, then follow the installation
instructions for that package.

## Usage

The executable is called `dp2`, or `dp2.exe` on Windows. Where exactly
this file is located depends on the installation.

In order to get an overview of the commands, run `dp2 help`:

    Usage: dp2 [GLOBAL_OPTIONS] COMMAND [COMMAND_OPTIONS]
    
    Script commands:{% sparql script in "SELECT ?id ?desc WHERE { [] a dp2:script ; dp2:id ?id ; dp2:desc ?desc } ORDER BY ?id" %}
        {{script.id}}{% assign len = script.id | size %}{% for i in (len..26) %}Â {% endfor %}{{script.desc}}{% endsparql %}

Configuration settings can be passed as options. In order to get the
