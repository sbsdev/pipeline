Braille Production Modules for the [DAISY Pipeline 2][pipeline].

Project layout
--------------
Because of the very modular nature of DAISY Pipeline 2, browsing the
code is not always easy. In order to make it more obvious where to
find a particular piece of code, I've tried to organize the modules
into subdirectories in a logical and consistent way.

- [`pipeline-braille-scripts`](pipeline-braille-scripts) contains the
  two top-level *scripts* that are presented to the end-user, notably
  `zedai-to-pef` and `dtbook-to-pef`.

- [`pipeline-braille-utils`](pipeline-braille-utils) contains everything
  else: all the low-level building blocks that the scripts are made up
  from. The building blocks are divided into logical *groups* such as
  `css-utils`, `pef-utils`, `liblouis-utils`, etc.

Building
--------
Build and run the unit tests with:

```sh
mvn clean install
```

The required version of Java is 8.

Semantic versioning
-------------------
Individual modules are versioned according to [SemVer](http://semver.org/). In order to ease the
release process, the correct version must be set whenever a change is made to a module (in both
`maven/bom/pom.xml` and module's own POM).

Release procedure
-----------------
- Version number should match next version of pipeline-assembly.

  ```sh
  VERSION=1.9.4
  ```

- Create a release branch.

  ```sh
  git checkout -b release/${VERSION}
  ```
  
- Resolve snapshot dependencies and commit.
- Generate release notes template, edit and commit. (View changes since previous release with `git diff v1.9.3...HEAD`, and look for relevant Github issues on [https://github.com/search](https://github.com/search?o=desc&q=involves%3Abertfrees+repo%3Adaisy%2Fpipeline-mod-braille+repo%3Asnaekobbi%2Fpipeline-mod-braille+repo%3Asnaekobbi%2Fissues+repo%3Asnaekobbi%2Fliblouis+repo%3Aliblouis%2Fliblouis+repo%3Asnaekobbi%2Fbraille-css+repo%3Asnaekobbi%2FjStyleParser+repo%3Ajoeha480%2Fdotify&s=updated&type=Issues))

  ```sh
  make release-notes
  ```

- Comment out all modules in the aggregator POMs that you don't want to release. Commit.
- Perform the release with Maven.

  ```sh
  mvn clean release:clean release:prepare
  mvn release:perform
  ```

- Revert the commit that commented out modules.
  
  ```sh
  git revert HEAD~2
  git reset --soft HEAD^
  ```

- Revert snapshot increments of modules in `maven/bom/pom.xml` and `maven/parent/pom.xml` and update
  parent version to new snapshot in all module POMs.
- Amend to the last commit.
- Push and make a pull request (for turning an existing issue into a PR use the `-i <issueno>` switch).

  ```sh
  git push -u origin release/${VERSION}:release/${VERSION}
  hub pull-request -b daisy:master -h daisy:release/${VERSION} -m "Release version ${VERSION}"
  ```
  
- Stage the artifact on https://oss.sonatype.org and comment on pull request.

  ```sh
  ghi comment -m staged ${ISSUE_NO}
  ```
  
- Test and stage all projects that depend on this release before continuing.
- Release the artifact on https://oss.sonatype.org and close pull request.

  ```sh
  ghi comment --close -m released ${ISSUE_NO}
  ```
  
- Push the tag.

  ```sh
  git push origin v${VERSION}
  ```

- Add a link to the release notes to http://github.com/daisy/pipeline-mod-braille/releases/v${VERSION}.
