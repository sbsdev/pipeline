	 *            is returned by TTSService.getSSMLxslTransformerURL().
	 * @param xmlSentence is the XML version of @param sentence. It should not
	 *            be used unless one needs information that has been lost during
	 *            the serialization process (e.g. marks or CSS)
	 * @param voice is the voice the synthesizer must use. It is guaranteed to
	 *            be one of those returned by getAvailableVoices(). This
	 *            parameter can't be null.
	 * @param threadResources is the object returned by
	 *            allocateThreadResource(). It may contain small persistent
	 *            buffers, opened file streams, TCP connections and so on. The
	 *            boolean field 'released' is guaranteed to be false, i.e. the
	 *            resource provided is always valid and will remain so during
	 *            the call.
	 * @param marks are the returned pairs (markName, offset-in-output)
	 *            corresponding to the ssml:marks of @param sentence. The order
	 *            must be kept. The provided list is always empty. The
	 *            offset-in-outputs are relative to the new buffers returned by
	 *            synthesize(). That is, they start at 0. If the service doesn't
	 *            handle SSML marks (i.e. endingmark() returns null). This
	 *            parameter may be set to null.
	 * @param expectedMarks are the mark names extracted from @param xmlSentence. The
	 * 	          TTS engine can use them if it doesn't play well with complicated/long
	 *            mark names, but it will harder to detect errors. It does include
	 *            the TTS provider's ending mark. The ending-mark can be set to anything if
	 *            the TTS processor or @param voice cannot handle marks. 
	 * @param bufferAllocator is the object that the TTS Service must use to
	 *            allocate new audio buffers.
	 * @param retry is true when this is not the first time the thread attempts
	 *            to synthesize @param sentence. In such cases, you may
	 *            reinitialize the connection to remote TTS servers if there are
