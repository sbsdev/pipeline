   happy medium would be off white to reduce "glare" and

   overrides stylesheets. The text is colored dark blue to

   W3C recommends "Line spacing (leading) is at least space-and-a-half
   within paragraphs"
   (https://www.w3.org/TR/2008/REC-WCAG20-20081211/#visual-audio-contrast-visual-presentation).

   MDN Web Docs recommends: "Use a minimum value of 1.5 for
   line-height for main paragraph content. This will help people
   experiencing low vision conditions, as well as people with
   cognitive concerns such as Dyslexia. If the page is zoomed to
   increase the text size, using a unitless value ensures that the
   line height will scale proportionately
   (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/line-height#Accessibility_concerns).

   So we multiply 1.2 by 1.5 which results in 1.8. */
