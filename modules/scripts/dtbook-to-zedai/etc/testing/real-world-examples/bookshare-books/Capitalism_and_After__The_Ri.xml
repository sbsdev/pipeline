          <p id="p_000026" smilref="Capitalism_and_After__The_Ri00001.smil#p_000026">Despite doing important original work in the field of Marxist theory on art and literature, George Thomson is seldom mentioned amongst the academic Marxist circles today. The reason is very obvious. The personality and work of George Thomson creates a lot of discomfort for academic Marxists. He was neither an intellectual confined to the ivory tower nor a bookworm. He was a man of the people. He was a revolutionary intellectual in the true sense of the term. He was a scholar of great depth of Marxist classics. He had an exceptional memory and had almost all the extracts and contexts on a given subject on his fingertips. In the field of Marxist art and literature his study was vast and his research extremely original. However, in spite of his various intellectual commitments he was active among the workers of Birmingham throughout his life. Along with taking political classes of the workers and organising their cultural troupes he also did organisational work of the party and was active in workers' movements. George Thomson was one of the few intellectuals of the West who stood like a rock against the revisionist wave in the Communist movement. He adopted the correct Marxist-Leninist stand against Khruschevite revisionism and the revisionism of the Chinese</p>

He played an exemplary role in acquainting the intellectuals, youth and Communist folds of the Western countries with the principles and experiments of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution of China (1966-76). George Thomson had the Communist courage to swim against the current and retained it till his last breath.</p>

            <span class="text" id="span_000010">Born in 1903, George Thomson was appointed the professor of Greek language and literature in Birmingham University in 1936 and in the same year he also joined the Communist Party of Great Britain. Due to his original and in depth Marxist analysis of Greek drama, his name was soon mentioned with the likes of Christopher Caudwell, Ralph Fox and Alec Best who were famous for their work on poetry, novel and criticism respectively. After the publication of</span>

            <span class="text" id="span_000013">was published in 1945 after which George Thomson was mentioned amongst the leading Marxist literary theorists. Along with these literary works he continuously wrote for Communist newspapers and magazines and wrote essays and pamphlets on Marxism and Workers' movement for the working class readership. By the end of 1940s he had become Britain's best-known teacher and writer on Marxism.</span>

It is important to note that he was the only member of the executive committee of the party to do this. George Thomson was deeply influenced by the Revolution in China and thoughts of Mao. He stood courageously against the wave of Khruschevite revisionism and disassociated himself with the British Communist party that had taken the path of revisionism. Even after leaving the party he continued the political-cultural work amongst the factory workers of Birmingham. In his classes on Marxism there was a huge attendance of students and young people along with the workers. In the 1950s he established the 'Socialist Theatre Company' with some writers, artists and theatre workers. He also established the 'Birmingham and Midland Folk Centre.'

            <span class="text" id="span_000017">In 1963, the Chinese Party started the 'Great Debate' against the revisionism of Soviet Communist party. By that time all the Communist parties of Europe including the CPGB had adopted the revisionist path. A vicious slander campaign against the Chinese Party and Mao Tse-Tung was on an upswing in Europe. To oppose this and to acquaint the working class, left intellectuals and Communist ranks of the West about the social-economic and political experiments going on in China and the reality of its achievements, George Thomson established the 'China Policy Study Group' in 1963, along with renowned economist Joan Robinson and some other Marxist-Leninist intellectuals. CPSG started the publication of a monthly bulletin by the name of 'Broadsheet' that was circulated in forty countries in large numbers. This bulletin was published continuously during the period of the Proletariat Cultural Revolution (1966-76). The 'China Policy Study Group' and the 'Broadsheet' played an extremely important role in acquainting the left intellectuals and the Communist folds of Britain, America and entire Europe with the theory and practice of Cultural Revolution and Socialist construction in China. With the objective to acquaint the Communist folds, youth and intellectuals, 'China Policy Study Group' published three books by George Thomson --</span>

Like a true Communist soldier George Thomson stood firm on the front of class-war till his last breath and never laid down his arms. He was a true example of a revolutionary intellectual.

The animals react on nature, but unconsciously. Even such apparently purposeful activities as the construction of a spider's web or a beehive are really no more than unconscious forms of adaptation, biologically inherited. In contrast to these, man's action on his environment is conscious:</p>

          <p id="p_000113" smilref="Capitalism_and_After__The_Ri00001.smil#p_000113">A spider conducts operations that resemble those of a weaver, and a bee puts to shame many an architect in the construction of her cells. But what distinguishes the worst of architects from the best of bees is this, that the architect raises his structure in the imagination before he erects it in reality. At the end of every labour-process we get a result that already existed in the imagination of the labourer at its commencement. (C 1.178.)</p>

          <p id="p_000135" smilref="Capitalism_and_After__The_Ri00001.smil#p_000135">In primitive society there was no production for exchange, only production for use. Both production and consumption were at first collective. The products of labour were shared out by the producers. The productivity of labour was so low that the combined efforts of the whole community were required to maintain it at the bare level of subsistence. There was no surplus. In the absence of surplus production, it was impossible for one man to live on the labour of another. Accordingly, there was no exploitation, no division into classes.</p>
          <p id="p_000136" smilref="Capitalism_and_After__The_Ri00001.smil#p_000136">With the development of surplus production, it became possible for individual producers to specialise in particular kinds of labour, or crafts. The craftsman produced certain articles in excess of his own needs and handed them over to the community in return for the means of subsistence, which he did not himself produce. The system of collective distribution ensured that each producer received the equivalent of his own labour. Thus divided, labour became more productive, and the surplus increased.</p>
          <p id="p_000137" smilref="Capitalism_and_After__The_Ri00001.smil#p_000137">With the further development of surplus production, the individual claimed the right to dispose of his surplus as he pleased. There arose a contradiction between individual production and collective distribution. This was resolved through the development of exchange, which began with barter. Two individuals, who had produced different articles, each in excess of his own needs, bartered them with one another. It was implicit in such acts that each recognised in the other the right of private ownership. As barter became more frequent, the producers began to produce goods regularly for the purpose of exchange. Production for use was superseded by production for exchange.</p>

Occupying areas of from one hundred to several thousand acres, each forms a compact whole, producing all it requires. The chief part of the products is destined for direct use by the community itself and does not take the form of a commodity. (C 1.357, cf. AD 197.)</p>

In so far as they are not consumed directly by the individual producers, they are distributed throughout the community in such a way that each receives for his own consumption the equivalent of what he has produced. The use-value of different products is measured by the time spent in producing them (C 1.71,3.874). Such calculations present no difficulty in a small community, in which divisions of labour are simple and the members are all bound together by personal ties. So long as these conditions persist, the distribution of the products of labour is subject to social control.</p>

With the development of production for exchange, the products of labour become exchange-values to be exchanged with one another in proportions agreed between the individual producers, who are now recognised as owners of the articles they have produced. They have freed themselves from the old communal ties, which were hampering the development of production, but at the same time they have become involved in a new system of relationships over which they have no control.</p>

It is only by chance that two producers meet, each having produced in excess of his own needs an article needed by the other. The circulation of commodities only begins when articles are produced regularly for the purpose of exchange; and this requires the use of some recognised medium of exchange, which will serve as their common measure.</p>
          <p id="p_000175" smilref="Capitalism_and_After__The_Ri00001.smil#p_000175">Gold and silver are commodities. Like other commodities, their value is determined by the amount of socially necessary labour-time required for their production. Mining is laborious, and these metals are scarce. Hence their value is high: a small piece of gold embodies a large amount of labour-time. They are also durable and easily divisible. These properties make them very suitable to serve as a medium of exchange. Accordingly, gold and silver were by common consent set apart from all other commodities in order that they might serve as their common measure or universal equivalent. Thus, money is a commodity whose use-value lies in the fact that it mediates the exchange of other commodities by providing them with a common measure of value.</p>

The expression of the value of a commodity in the form of coined metal is its money-form or price. The price of a commodity is an imaginary quantity of the coined metal embodying the same amount of abstract labour as the commodity. The function of money as a measure of value is not affected by variations in the value of the metal, for such variations affect all commodities equally, leaving their relative value unchanged.</p>

Its value is determined, as has been shown, by the amount of socially necessary labour-time embodied in it, and that in turn by the social and historical conditions in which it is produced. These conditions are continually changing. In addition, there are short-term variations in the conditions of production and consumption, such as a good or a bad harvest, which give rise to fluctuations of supply and demand.

They must, therefore, mutually recognise in each other the rights of private proprietors...The persons exist for one another merely as representatives, and therefore as owners, of commodities.

          <p id="p_000186" smilref="Capitalism_and_After__The_Ri00001.smil#p_000186">In the second place, it is necessary that there should exist between the producers a social division of labour, each producing in excess of his own needs a certain product which others need. What has only an exchange-value for him must have a use-value for others, and conversely what has a use-value for him must have only an exchange-value for others, otherwise the exchanges cannot take place:</p>
          <p id="p_000187" smilref="Capitalism_and_After__The_Ri00001.smil#p_000187">His commodity possesses for himself no immediate use-value; otherwise he would not bring it to the market. It has use-value for others, but for himself its only direct use-value is that of being a depository of exchange-value and consequently a means of exchange. Therefore, he makes up his mind to part with it for commodities whose value in use is of service to him. All commodities are non-use-values for their owners and use-values for their non-owners. Consequently, they must all change hands. But this change of hands is what constitutes their exchange, and the latter puts them into relation with each other as values, and realises them as values. Hence, commodities must be realised as values before they can be realised as use-values. On the other hand, they must show that they are use-values before they can be realised as values; for the labour that is spent on them counts effectively only in so far as it is spent in a form that is useful for others. Whether that labour is useful for others, and its product consequently capable of satisfying the wants of others, can be proved only by the act of exchange. (C 1.85.)</p>

The weaver who brings his linen to market is ready to offer it in exchange for any other commodity he may wish to acquire: for him, therefore, the linen is a universal equivalent. But the same is true of the shoemaker, the joiner, and every other commodity-owner. What is a universal equivalent for each one of them is only a particular equivalent for the others. For commodities to circulate freely, there must be a universal equivalent which is socially recognised as such:</p>
          <p id="p_000190" smilref="Capitalism_and_After__The_Ri00001.smil#p_000190">To the owner of a commodity, every other commodity is, in regard to his own, a particular equivalent, and consequently his own commodity is the universal equivalent of all the others. But, once this applies to every owner, there is in fact no commodity acting as universal equivalent and the relative value of commodities possesses no general form under which they can be equated as values and have the magnitude of their values compared. So far, therefore, they do not confront each other as commodities, but only as products or use-values...but a particular commodity cannot become the universal equivalent except by a social act. The social action, therefore, of all other commodities sets apart the particular commodity in which they all represent their values. Thereby the bodily form of this commodity becomes the form of the socially-recognised universal equivalent. (C 1.86.)</p>
          <p id="p_000191" smilref="Capitalism_and_After__The_Ri00001.smil#p_000191">Let, us now look more closely into the actual process of exchange (CI.103-14).</p>
          <p id="p_000192" smilref="Capitalism_and_After__The_Ri00001.smil#p_000192">A weaver sells so many yards of linen and with the money he receives for it he buys a pair of shoes. The transaction consists of two phases--a sale and a purchase. A commodity is changed into money (C--M) and money is changed into a commodity (M--C). The process may therefore be represented by the formula C--M-- C. It takes the form of a circuit, in which one commodity is exchanged by means of money into another commodity of the same value but of a different kind. Accordingly, having acquired the shoes in exchange for the linen, our weaver goes home:</p>
          <p id="p_000193" smilref="Capitalism_and_After__The_Ri00001.smil#p_000193">From his point of view, the whole process effects nothing more than the exchange of the product of his labour for the product of someone else's, nothing more than an exchange of products. (C.1.105.)</p>

          <p id="p_000194" smilref="Capitalism_and_After__The_Ri00001.smil#p_000194">On further examination, however, it turns out that the matter is not so simple. The money which the weaver receives for his linen has been acquired by its purchaser through the sale of some other commodity; and it passes from the weaver to the shoemaker, who will spend it on the purchase of some other commodity. Thus, the circuits are interlinked:</p>
          <p id="p_000195" smilref="Capitalism_and_After__The_Ri00001.smil#p_000195">The first metamorphosis of one commodity, its transformation from a commodity into money, is also invariably the second metamorphosis of some other commodity, the re-transformation of the latter from money into a commodity. (C 1.110.)</p>
          <p id="p_000196" smilref="Capitalism_and_After__The_Ri00001.smil#p_000196">Hence the circuit made by one commodity in the course of its metamorphoses is inextricably mixed up with the circuits of other commodities. The total of all the different circuits constitutes the circulation of commodities. (C 1.112.)</p>
          <p id="p_000197" smilref="Capitalism_and_After__The_Ri00001.smil#p_000197">Consequently, each act of sale and purchase, which is for the commodity-owner complete in itself, is only one moment in a series of similar acts extended indefinitely in place and time. For all their fancied independence, the owners of commodities are bound together in a nexus of mutually determining relationships, of which they have no knowledge and over which they have no control:</p>
          <p id="p_000198" smilref="Capitalism_and_After__The_Ri00001.smil#p_000198">We see here, on the one hand, how the exchange of commodities breaks through all local and personal bounds inseparable from direct barter, and on the other hand how it develops a whole network of social relations spontaneous in their growth and entirely beyond the control of the actors. (C 1.112.)</p>
          <p id="p_000199" smilref="Capitalism_and_After__The_Ri00001.smil#p_000199">Furthermore, the process involved in the circulation of commodities is such that to the participants it appears, in its totality, not as a combined movement of commodities and money, the latter being merely the expression of the former, but as a circulation of money alone. As the linen leaves the weaver's hands, money takes its place; as the money leaves his hands, the shoes take its place. The commodities and the money move simultaneously in opposite directions. But, whereas the money retains its form throughout, each commodity is successively transformed and removed from circulation. Hence, in the case of the commodities the continuity of the movement is disguised, and the illusion is created that the</p>

          <p id="p_000201" smilref="Capitalism_and_After__The_Ri00001.smil#p_000201">Hence, although the movement of the money is merely the expression of the circulation of commodities, yet the contrary appears to be the actual fact, and the circulation of commodities seems to be the result of the movement of the money. (C 1.116.)</p>
          <p id="p_000202" smilref="Capitalism_and_After__The_Ri00001.smil#p_000202">The circuit C--M--C is a unity of sale and purchase, and, so long as this unity is preserved, the circulation of commodities consists in the exchange of equivalents. But, unlike barter, the exchange of commodities is subject to no restrictions of time or place. The prospective seller must, of course, find a buyer; but, having sold, he is not immediately obliged to buy. He may decide to keep his money for a purchase to be made at a later date or in another place. In this way the unity of the process is disrupted. Given the separation of sale and purchase, the circulation of commodities becomes subject to irregularities, which may, in certain conditions to be discussed later, precipitate a crisis:</p>
          <p id="p_000203" smilref="Capitalism_and_After__The_Ri00001.smil#p_000203">If the interval in time between the two complementary phases of the complete process becomes too great, if the split between sale and purchase becomes too pronounced, the intimate connection between them, their oneness, asserts itself by producing--a crisis. (C 1.113.)</p>
          <p id="p_000204" smilref="Capitalism_and_After__The_Ri00001.smil#p_000204">The possibility of economic crises is inherent in the circulation of commodities, and their causes must necessarily remain unknown, so long as the nature of that process is not understood. A commodity is a unity of opposites. On the one hand, it must be a use-value before it can be realised as an exchange-value; on the other, it must become an exchange-value before it can be realised as a use-value. Its twofold transformation, from use-value to exchange-value and from exchange-value to use-value, is mediated by money. Transformed from a commodity into money, it sheds its use-value and becomes pure exchange-value; transformed from money into another commodity, it sheds its exchange-value and becomes a use-value. If, however, the process is interrupted, a situation may arise in which there is an accumulation of products which cannot be realised as use-values because they cannot be realised as exchange-values. In other words, they cannot be consumed, not because nobody wants them, but because those who want them have not the money to buy</p>

The dikes were built by mass labour drawn from the village communities comprised within a single catchment area and organised by the chiefs or priests, who specialised in engineering, astronomy and other aspects of flood control (C 1.514, n.l). In this way the groups of villages grew into towns, and the chiefs, the organisers of production, established themselves as custodians, or owners, of the means of production--in other words, a ruling class. Thus, the division of society into classes originated as a new--qualitatively new--division of labour, a division between mental and manual labour. Appropriating the surplus value produced by the manual workers, the ruling class used it to develop new capacities, new divisions of labour, and new branches of mental labour.

But the rich peasant or landowner can afford to wait. He is not constrained to sell; and, if he does sell, he may postpone his purchase to another day. Taking advantage of day-to-day fluctuations in market prices, he can sell dear and buy cheap. From this it is only a short step to the next stage, in which he buys cheap in order to sell dear.</p>
          <p id="p_000217" smilref="Capitalism_and_After__The_Ri00001.smil#p_000217">There is a story told of Thales, the first of the Greek philosophers. It was shortly before his time, and not far from his birthplace, that the coinage was invented. One winter, being an expert in astronomy, he predicted an abundant harvest, and for a small sum of money he hired all the local olive-presses. In due course there was a bumper crop, creating a keen demand for the presses, and by letting them out at exorbitant prices Thales made a fortune. Thus, the first philosopher was also the first financier. This was only a beginning. In our own day we have seen speculators buying up world stocks of some raw material in order to sell it again at a profit.</p>

He changes a commodity into money and changes the money into another commodity: C--M--C. But the merchant buys in order to sell. He changes money into a commodity and changes the commodity back into money: M--C-- M. This is the formula for the circulation of money as capital:</p>

In the one case both the starting-point and the goal are commodities, in the other they are money. In the first form the movement is brought about by the intervention of money, in the second by that of a commodity. (C 1.148.)</p>

This increment or excess over the original value I call 'surplus value.' The value originally advanced, therefore, not only remains intact while in circulation, but adds to itself a surplus value or expands itself. It is this movement that conveits it into capital. (C 1.150.)</p>
          <p id="p_000225" smilref="Capitalism_and_After__The_Ri00001.smil#p_000225">In the simple circulation of commodities each circuit is limited by the fact of its being a means to an end.

          <p id="p_000226" smilref="Capitalism_and_After__The_Ri00001.smil#p_000226">The simple circulation of commodities--selling in order to buy--is a means of carrying out a purpose unconnected with circulation, namely, the appropriation of use-values, the satisfaction of wants. The circulation of money as capital is, on the contrary, an end in itself, for the expansion of value takes place only within this constantly renewed movement. The circulation of capital, therefore, has no limits. (C 1.151.)</p>
          <p id="p_000227" smilref="Capitalism_and_After__The_Ri00001.smil#p_000227">Merchants' capital has always been associated with money-lending (usury). Like the merchant, the money-lender begins each operation with money and ends it with more money. The increment is his 'interest,' that is, the payment which he exacts for the hire of his capital. Merchants have always been ready to make money out of usury, and have often relied on usurers to finance their enterprises, like Shakespeare's Merchant of Venice. Money-lending develops into banking. The banker may be described as a merchant who deals in capital.</p>

A merchant buys grain in one region, where there is a glut, and sells it in another, where there is a famine. Or he may obtain precious metals in exchange for trash from some primitive people, which has not yet developed a 'commercial sense,' and sell them in his own country at current prices. The truth is that, in its initial stages--and later too, whenever opportunity offers--merchants' capital is indistinguishable from robbery:</p>
          <p id="p_000230" smilref="Capitalism_and_After__The_Ri00001.smil#p_000230">Merchants' capital, when it holds a position of dominance, stands everywhere for a system of robbery, so that its development among the nations of ancient and modern times is always directly connected with plundering, piracy, kidnapping slaves, and colonial conquest.

          <p id="p_000231" smilref="Capitalism_and_After__The_Ri00001.smil#p_000231">As more settled conditions supervene, mercantile relations approximate more closely to an exchange of equivalents, with the merchant as middleman:</p>
          <p id="p_000232" smilref="Capitalism_and_After__The_Ri00001.smil#p_000232">To buy cheap in order to sell dear is the rule of trade; hence, not the exchange of equivalents.... The quantitative ratio in which products are exchanged is at first quite arbitrary.... Continued exchange, and more regular reproduction for exchange, reduce this arbitrariness more and more: but at first not for the producer and consumer, only for their go-between, the merchant, who compares money prices and pockets the difference. It is through his own movements that he establishes equivalence. (C 3.324.)</p>
          <p id="p_000233" smilref="Capitalism_and_After__The_Ri00001.smil#p_000233">Meanwhile, within each community, the merchant mediates the commerce between urban and rural producers. The division between town and country is a permanent feature of class society (GI 64). Taking advantage of its dominant position, economic and political, the town exploits the country by imposing its own prices, buying cheap and selling dear (C 3.781).</p>
          <p id="p_000234" smilref="Capitalism_and_After__The_Ri00001.smil#p_000234">Thus, as one who, by force or fraud, appropriates the fruit of another man's labour, the merchant is no less of robber than the pirate. The practice of buying cheap and selling dear was condemned for that reason both by Aristotle and by the medieval Church. It is only in proportion as the merchant class acquires wealth and power as its activities become respectable. The old morality is negated by the new.</p>

In ancient society it was based on slave labour, in medieval society on serf-labour about, in modern society on wage-labour. The capitalist system, based on wage-labour and machine industry, marks the highest stage in the evolution of commodity production.</p>

          <p id="p_000238" smilref="Capitalism_and_After__The_Ri00001.smil#p_000238">Let us now picture to ourselves...a community of free individuals, carrying on their work with the means of production in common, in which the labour-power of all the different individuals is consciously applied as the combined labour of the community. The total product of our community is a social product. One portion serves as fresh means of production and remains social. Another portion is consumed by the members as means of subsistence, A distribution of this portion among them is consequently necessary. The mode of this distribution will vary with the productive organisation of the community and the degree of historical development attained by the producers. We will assume, but merely for the sake of a parallel with the production of commodities, that the share of each individual producer is determined by his labour-time. Labour-time would in that case play a double part. Its apportionment in accordance with a definite social plan maintains the proper proportion between the different kinds of work to be done and the various wants of the community. On the other hand, it also serves as a measure of the portion of the common labour borne by each individual, and of his share in the part of the total product destined for individual consumption. The social relations of the individual producers, with regard both to their labour and to its products, are in this case perfectly simple and intelligible, and that with regard not only to production but also to distribution.

The producers have lost control of their products and of their relations with one another. Disguised as commodities, the products of labour seem to derive their value, not from the labour embodied in them, but from that special commodity, money, with which they are all directly exchangeable; and, since money is made of gold or silver, value becomes in their eyes a mysterious property with which those metals have been endowed by nature;</p>
          <p id="p_000242" smilref="Capitalism_and_After__The_Ri00001.smil#p_000242">What appears to happen is not that gold becomes money in consequence of all other commodities expressing their values in it, but on the contrary that all other commodities express their values in gold, because it is money. The intermediate steps in the process vanish in the result and leave no trace behind. Commodities find their own value completely represented, without any initiative on their part, in another commodity existing in company with them. These objects, gold and silver, just as they come out of the bowels of the earth, are forthwith the direct incarnation of all human labour. Hence the magic of money. (C 1.92.)</p>

I dare be bold to say that in the end of that penury so much corn or grain might have been found in the rich men's barns, if they had been searched, as being divided among those whom famine and pestilence then consumed, no man at all should have felt that plague and penury. So easily might men get their living, if that same worthy princess Lady Money did not alone stop up the way between us and our living, which in God's name was very excellently devised and invented that by her the way thereto should be opened.

Unable to identify the true cause of the famine, he can only ascribe it to the capricious behaviour of Lady Money. Thus, money, a product of man's labour which he is no longer able to control, becomes in his eyes an alien power with a life and a will of its own.</p>

Therefore, in so far as they buy below value or sell above value, they do so at each other's expense. Individual capitalists may gain in this way, but they cannot gain as a class. It follows that this cannot be the source of their profit (ME 2.54, LCW 21.62).</p>
          <p id="p_000264" smilref="Capitalism_and_After__The_Ri00001.smil#p_000264">What the capitalist buys from his workers is not their labour, but their labour-power, that is, their capacity to work--their physical energy and skill (C 1.537). Labour-power is a commodity, whose use-value is labour (C 1.77, 193). Having acquired the 'means of production' (a factory, tools, machinery, raw materials, etc.), our capitalist enters into a contract with the workers to hire their labour-power for a specified period of time at so much an hour. The labour which they expend in that period belongs to him, just as the machinery and the materials belong to him. Operating his machines, they apply their labour to the materials, transforming them into new commodities. These commodities, which embody the additional value created by their labour, belong to the capitalist. At the end of the period, he pays them their wages, which represent, not the additional value created by their labour, but the price of their labour-power:</p>

Long before the linen is sold, perhaps before its weaving is finished, the weaver has received his wages. The capitalist pays these wages, not with the money he will receive from the linen, but with money already in reserve.... It is possible that his employer found no purchaser at all for his linen; it is possible that he did not even get the amount of the wages by its sale; it is possible that he sells it very profitably in comparison with the weaver's wages. All that has nothing to do with the weaver. The capitalist buys the weaver's labour-power with a part of his available wealth, of his capital, just as he has bought the raw material--the yam--and the instrument of labour--the loom--with another part of his wealth. After he has made these purchases, including the labour-power necessary for the production of linen, he produces only</span>

The price of this cost of existence and reproduction constitutes wages. Wages so determined are called the wage minimum. This wage minimum, like the determination of the price of commodities by the cost of production in general, does not hold good for the single individual but only for the species. Individual workers, millions of them, do not get enough to be able to exist and reproduce themselves; but the wages of the whole working class level down, within their fluctuations, to this minimum.

          <p id="p_000271" smilref="Capitalism_and_After__The_Ri00001.smil#p_000271">Wages rise and fall. What determines these fluctuations? Here, too, labour-power behaves like other commodities. In the conditions of commodity production, in which the relation between production and consumption is determined blindly by the market, the available supply of every commodity is liable, at any given moment, to exceed, or fall short of, the demand. The same anarchy prevails in the labour market as in the market for other commodities. First, there is competition between the buyers and sellers of labour-power, the former looking for 'cheap labour' and the latter for a 'decent wage.' This is the principal contradiction. Secondly, there is competition between the buyers: hence, if there are more jobs to be filled than there are workers available, wages will rise. Thirdly, there is competition between the sellers: hence, if there are more workers looking for jobs than there are jobs available, wages will fall (ME 1.158).

It must be distinguished from merchants' capital, which is found in all stages of class society. Like the merchant, the capitalist appropriates surplus value; but, whereas the merchant does this simply by intervening in the process of circulation, the capitalist appropriation of surplus value takes place within the process of production. This will become clear if we compare the formula for the circulation of merchants' capital (M--C--M') with the formula for the circulation of capital: M--C--P--C--M'. Here P stands for the process of production.</p>

The slave surrenders the entire product of his labour, including his necessary labour, which, however, is returned to him as means of subsistence. To the slave, therefore, all labour appears as unpaid. The serf surrenders a portion of his product, in the form either of so much grain from his own holding or of so much labour on his lord's estate; and he retains the rest. Thus, in serfdom the distinction between necessary and surplus labour, between paid and unpaid labour, is open and unconcealed. In wage-labour it is veiled by the market. The worker owns a commodity, labour-power, which he is nominally free to sell or not to sell; but actually, since he owns nothing else, he is forced to sell it. If he cannot find anyone to buy it, he starves. Then, having sold it, he finds, like every other commodity-owner, that he has lost control of it, and in his confusion he is persuaded that what he receives in wages represents, not the price of his commodity, labour-power, but the value of what he produces:</p>

All labour appears as paid labour. In the corvee, the worker's labour for himself and his compulsory labour for his lord differ in space and time in the clearest possible way. In slave-labour, even that part of the working day in which the slave is only replacing the value of his own means of existence, in which, therefore, he works for himself alone, appears as labour for his master. All the slave's labour appears as unpaid labour. In wage-labour, on the contrary, even surplus labour, or unpaid labour, appears as paid. There, the property relation conceals the labour of the slave for himself; here, the money relation conceals the unrequited labour of the wage-labourer. (C 1.539.)</p>

          <p id="p_000310" smilref="Capitalism_and_After__The_Ri00001.smil#p_000310">In the beginning, the producer took his surplus product to market and exchanged it for some other product which he needed for his own consumption. This was an exchange of equivalents. Later, the merchant, a non-producer, intervened in the process of exchange so as to appropriate from the producers a portion of the value which they had produced. His aim was not the exchange of equivalents but the accumulation of surplus value. This was a new factor, which revolutionised the mode of production. Eventually, when labour-power itself has become a commodity, the appropriation of surplus value takes place within the actual process of production. The exchange between capitalist and worker is still nominally an exchange of equivalents, since they meet in the market as equals, but this is now merely an illusion:</p>
          <p id="p_000311" smilref="Capitalism_and_After__The_Ri00001.smil#p_000311">The laws of appropriation, or of private property--laws that are based on the production and circulation of commodities--are by their own inner and inexorable dialectic changed into their very opposite. The exchange of equivalents, the original operation with which we started, has now been turned round in such a way that there is only an apparent exchange. This is owing to the fact, first, that the capital which is exchanged for labour-power is itself but a portion of others' labour, appropriated without an equivalent, and, secondly, that this capital must not only be replaced by its producer, but replaced with an added surplus. The relation of</p>

          <p id="p_000312" smilref="Capitalism_and_After__The_Ri00001.smil#p_000312">exchange subsisting between capitalist and labourer becomes a mere semblance appertaining to the process of circulation, a mere form, foreign to the real nature of the transaction and serving only to mystify it. The ever-repeated purchase and sale of labour-power is now the mere form. What really takes place is this. The capitalist appropriates again and again, without equivalent, a portion of the previously materialised labour of others, and exchanges it for a greater quantity of living labour. (C 1.583, cf. PEF 114.)</p>
          <p id="p_000313" smilref="Capitalism_and_After__The_Ri00001.smil#p_000313">For the wage-worker, therefore, labour is not the exercise of his life activity, but rather the negation of that activity, because it is no longer his. He sells his life activity in order that he may live:</p>

            <span class="text" id="span_000117">But the exercise of labour-power, labour, is the worker's own life activity, the manifestation of his own life. And this life activity he sells to another person in order to secure the necessary means of subsistence. Thus, his life activity is for him only a means to enable him to exist. He works in order to live. He does not even reckon labour as part of his life, it is rather a sacrifice of his life. 3t is a commodity which he has made over to another. Hence also the product of his activity is not the object of his activity. What he produces for himself is not the silk that he weaves, not the gold that he draws from the mine, not the palace he builds. What he produces for himself is</span>

Thus, the stage of class society, whose end is already in sight, represents only a small fraction of man's history. During all but the latter end of the preceding period, he lived in small, scattered communities, always on the move, producing "only for use, with no social divisions of labour and only , the most rudimentary tools, and with a social structure still based on natural relations.</p>
          <p id="p_000322" smilref="Capitalism_and_After__The_Ri00001.smil#p_000322">The tribal structure of society rested on kinship, reckoned through the mother. Each tribe was composed of, two moieties, and each moiety of two or more clans. Mating was permitted only between men and women belonging to different moieties. When the tribe pitched camp, the tribal structure was reproduced in the territorial layout. The camp took the form of a circle, divided into semicircles and quarters, with a place for each clan in the appropriate quarter. This circle, with its four quarters, became the model for primitive conceptions of the universe.</p>
          <p id="p_000323" smilref="Capitalism_and_After__The_Ri00001.smil#p_000323">Tribal society was based on common ownership. In the earlier stages, the principle of equal shares had been accepted without question as a natural necessity. Later, when the clan had begun to disintegrate into families, the principle became a recognised social norm. The pasture was held in common, while the arable was divided into strips and periodically redistributed in such a way that each family</p>

          <p id="p_000325" smilref="Capitalism_and_After__The_Ri00001.smil#p_000325">Tribal society was democratic. There was a tribal council, composed of the clan chiefs or elders, appointed by the clans. All these held office by election and were subject to recall. The council met in the presence of the assembled tribes people, men and women, whose approval was required for its decisions. In the absence of exploitation, there was no need for a special body of persons charged with the maintenance of law and order.</p>
          <p id="p_000326" smilref="Capitalism_and_After__The_Ri00001.smil#p_000326">The break-up of tribal society was precipitated by warfare. Increase of population gave rise to inter-tribal disputes, and these in turn to marauding raids, conducted by one of the chiefs with a band of volunteers. The booty captured on such occasions was divided by the raiders among themselves, with a special share for the chief, which became his property. With the further development of warfare, the conquerors killed the men, enslaved the women and children, and took possession of the land. The slaves and the land were distributed by lot, and again special shares were set aside for the chiefs. In some cases the inhabitants were left in occupation of the land, which they cultivated for the conquerors as serfs. They were regarded as belonging, together with the conquered territory, to the 'inorganic conditions' of the reproduction of the conquerors (PEF 91) and hence not fully human.</p>
          <p id="p_000327" smilref="Capitalism_and_After__The_Ri00001.smil#p_000327">In the course of time contending tribes and tribal leagues merged into kingdoms controlled by an aristocracy of chiefs under a single supreme ruler. His residence became the administrative centre. The division between town and country resulted in the separation of the handicrafts from agriculture, creating new possibilities of surplus production. At the same time, the old tribal relations, based on kinship reckoned through the mother, were being undermined. The new unit, superseding the clan, was the patriarchal family. This was closely identified with a holding of land, which, together with all other rights of property, was hereditary in the male line. The subjection of women within the family was the counterpart to the growth of exploitation in society at large.</p>

          <p id="p_000329" smilref="Capitalism_and_After__The_Ri00001.smil#p_000329">The underlying factor in the evolution of the productive forces in ancient society was the discovery of metal-working-first bronze and then iron. Without metal tools large-scale agriculture would have been impossible. Bronze-working was a costly process, requiring capital. Accordingly, it was developed under the control of the same priests who, as we have already remarked, directed agriculture. The power of this priestly class was embodied in the person of the king, who was both high priest and war chief, and was worshipped as a god.</p>
          <p id="p_000330" smilref="Capitalism_and_After__The_Ri00001.smil#p_000330">In both Mesopotamia and Egypt, the initial period in the history of these Bronze Age states was distinguished by a proliferation of technical inventions and a rapid growth of commodity production; but the pressure for further social changes was successfully resisted by the established ruling class, and accordingly there ensued, especially in Egypt, a long period of political and cultural stagnation.</p>
          <p id="p_000331" smilref="Capitalism_and_After__The_Ri00001.smil#p_000331">Iron was more difficult to work than bronze; but, once the process had been mastered, the new metal was not only superior in itself but more plentiful and hence more easily available to the common man. Discovered in Armenia and disseminated by pastoral invaders from the north, the art of iron-working brought about the collapse of the Mesopotamian monarchies, based on bronze-working. Eventually, the whole area, from the Nile to the Indus, was united in the Persian Empire, which, with its civil service, its elaborate system of communications, and its imperial coinage, was the most highly organised of all the ancient empires prior to the Roman.</p>
          <p id="p_000332" smilref="Capitalism_and_After__The_Ri00001.smil#p_000332">The Greek city-states were clustered along the western fringes of the Near Eastern area. They were a product of uneven development. On the one hand, they started as tribal settlements, and they developed so rapidly as to preserve their tribal character throughout their history; on the other, they were formed from the outset on the basis of iron-working, and their maritime situation was exceptionally favourable for the growth of trade. Hence, in contrast to the hieratic monarchies of the Asiatic hinterland, their characteristic form was republican. Every adult male capable of bearing arms possessed a share of land and a vote in the assembly. Citizenship was identical with landownership (PEF 73). In time the chiefs and their families consolidated their position as a class of big landowners ruling over a</p>

In some cities there was also a subject population, which had been reduced to serfdom at the time of settlement. Meanwhile, with the growth of maritime trade, there was an influx of slave labour. Slavery had long been established in the Near Eastern states, but mostly in the form of captives taken in war or persons enslaved for debt. Now the slave became a commodity. Bought up or kidnapped by Greek traders in backward regions of the Mediterranean, these human cattle were shipped to Greece and sold in the slave markets. The slave trade was thus an important factor in the rise of the merchant class. Placing themselves at the head of the peasants and artisans, the merchants overthrew the landed nobility, divided their estates among the peasantry, and introduced a democratic constitution.</p>
          <p id="p_000334" smilref="Capitalism_and_After__The_Ri00001.smil#p_000334">With this revolution, which completed the transition from tribe to state, the Greek city-state entered on a new stage, in which 'slavery seized on production in earnest' (C 1.334). In this stage, the principal contradiction was no longer the conflict between the landed nobleman and the free peasant but the conflict between the slave-owner and the slave. The landowners, merchants and money-lenders now merged into a single slave-owning class. The poor citizens, though exploited by the rich, did not form an alliance with the slaves; on the contrary, their aim was to secure a share in slave-ownership for themselves. Land was now fully alienable, and so the link between landownership and citizenship had been severed. The separate identity of the city-states thus became an impediment to commercial expansion. Divided by petty feuds among themselves, they fell an easy prey to the Macedonians, who formed a warlike kingdom, still semi-tribal, on their northern borders. Having subjugated the Greeks, the Macedonians turned east, and under their king Alexander they overran the Persian Empire, which was already inwardly rotten, and extended their conquests as far as India. The whole of the Near East was thus drawn into the orbit of Mediterranean trade.</p>

Nevertheless, despite the growth of merchant capital, there was no corresponding progress in the handicrafts (C 3.327). No further advance was possible within the limits imposed by slavery on both production and consumption. The Empire sank into a slow decline, which was all the more protracted, because the slaves, being bound up with the old mode of production, were incapable of leading a revolution. The transition from slavery to serfdom had already begun under the Empire. It was completed when the Germanic tribes, which, through contact with the Romans, had developed an efficient military organisation, went over to the offensive and invaded the imperial provinces, where they met with little resistance.</p>

The feudal system took shape gradually out of the tribal institutions of the conquerors as modified by military needs and their new status in relation to the conquered (GI 90). The result was that, when commodity production began to revive, it was on a new technical basis. Owing to the decline of slavery, there was now a shortage of labour, but at the same time there was available a new type of labourer--men who were free, yet not ashamed to work with their hands:</p>

          <p id="p_000342" smilref="Capitalism_and_After__The_Ri00001.smil#p_000342">Feudal society was hierarchical. In the countryside it was based on the manor, derived ultimately from the primitive commune. The status of every member, from lord to serf, was fixed by birth. The arable was still, as in tribal times, cultivated in strips, with a prescribed portion assigned to the lord; the pasture belonged nominally to the lord but by custom was open to all. The privileges enjoyed by the lord were founded on the traditional status of the tribal chief. In the towns, the unit of production was the guild. This institution, derived from the clan, was to serve as a model for the trade unions of a later age. Each of the main crafts had its own guild, whose members were graded as masters, apprentices, and journeymen, and subject to a code of conduct, which governed their working conditions, upheld the principles of reciprocity and mutual aid, and protected them from outside competition.</p>
          <p id="p_000343" smilref="Capitalism_and_After__The_Ri00001.smil#p_000343">The principal contradiction of feudal society was the antagonism between lord and serf. It was intensified by the revival of commodity production, which brought into being a new class of merchants, precursors of the modern bourgeoisie. The merchants found themselves in conflict both with the feudal lords, whose rights of landownership were threatened by the growth of monetary relations, and with the guilds, whose restrictive practices were an impediment to trade. As monetary relations penetrated the countryside, the serf's feudal dues were commuted into money rent, and he became a tenant farmer. Runaway serfs found refuge in the towns, where they formed the nucleus of an urban working class.</p>

There is a parallel between the rise of the Italian mercantile republics and the rise of the early Greek city-states, but the later process started at a higher level. Whereas the ancient Greeks had opened up the Mediterranean, the Italians, Spaniards and Portuguese opened up the world market (GI 72); and so there began 'a new epoch in the process of social production' (C 1.170).</p>

Iron-working began comparatively late, but developed rapidly from smelting to casting--an advance not made in Europe till the Middle Ages. Since casting was too expensive for the independent artisan, the iron industry became a state monopoly. There was a rapid expansion of agriculture, based on irrigation and forest clearance, and rights of private property were established in land and slaves; but, although very influential, the merchants never became independent of the ruling nobility. After a period of destructive wars between the rival states the country was unified under the Ch'in Dynasty. The merchants and landowners merged into a single feudal class. All industry and trade was brought under state control, and the village communes were reorganised as communities of small proprietors, subject to rent, taxes and forced labour. The rent was due to the big landowners, the taxes and labour to the state. As the burden of taxation grew, many peasants were forced to sell their land to the big landowners, who paid no taxes. In order to maintain its revenue, the central government imposed still heavier taxes on the remaining freeholders, thereby destroying its own financial basis. The crisis issued in a peasant revolt, in which, after enormous casualties among the peasantry, the land was redivided, but without any change in the class structure, and so the cycle began all over again. It was these recurrent crises that determined the rise and fall of Chinese dynasties.</p>

These were unified under a highly-centralised monarchy, which, with its imperial coinage, civil service and standing army, resembled the Persian.

Indian feudalism was founded on the primitive village community, which had preserved its tribal structure with very little change. It rested on common ownership of the soil, the union of agriculture and handicrafts, and hereditary divisions of labour enforced by caste. It was subject to tribute in kind, payable to the lord, who passed on a portion of it to the king; but in all other respects it was self-sufficient.</p>
          <p id="p_000350" smilref="Capitalism_and_After__The_Ri00001.smil#p_000350">Thus, there were marked divergences in the forms of pre-capitalist society as it evolved in Europe, China and India; yet, despite these differences, they are rightly regarded as parallel manifestations of a single process, marked by uneven development. If the basic factor in the evolution of class society is the growth of commodity production, it follows that this is the direction in which the whole of pre-capitalist society was moving; and if, in the final stage, the lead was taken by the West, the reason is that it was there that the necessary combination of socio-economic conditions was first realised. These will be discussed in the next chapter.</p>

It was a unique phenomenon in the ancient world.</p>
          <p id="p_000353" smilref="Capitalism_and_After__The_Ri00001.smil#p_000353">In Greece, the transition from tribe to state was exceptionally rapid. It was effected at a time when there was still a free peasantry, tenacious of its tribal traditions. In Rome, the landed nobles maintained themselves in power by means of territorial expansion, but in Greece at this time none of the city-states was strong enough to subjugate the others, and so the internal class struggle was intensified. The result was that in many of them, especially those situated along the trade routes, the landed aristocracy was overthrown and replaced by a new form of state representing the interests of the merchant class</p>

It has already been noted that the merchants, who led the democratic movement, derived a large part of their wealth from the slave trade. There was, therefore, a close connection between the democratic movement and the growth of chattel slavery.</p>
          <p id="p_000355" smilref="Capitalism_and_After__The_Ri00001.smil#p_000355">In form, the democratic constitution was consciously modelled on the tribal system. The organisation of the citizen body in tribal units, the popular assembly, the franchise--all these tribal institutions, which had fallen into abeyance under the aristocracy, were revived; and for this reason the new constitution was accepted by the people as marking the restoration of their lost tribal equality. But this was an illusion. The form of the new society was contradicted by its content. The new tribal units were based on locality and private property, not kinship and common ownership; the citizens who exercised the franchise on the principle of one man one vote, were living on slave-labour. By following so closely the tribal model the new constitution concealed all the more effectively the fact that all obstacles to the growth of a monetary economy, and with them the last vestiges of primitive communism, had been swept away. Now, for the first time in history, men confronted one another as independent commodity-owners in the freedom and equality of the open market.</p>
          <p id="p_000356" smilref="Capitalism_and_After__The_Ri00001.smil#p_000356">To these contradictions the ideologists of democracy were blind. As members of an exploiting class, they started from the unquestioned assumption that exploitation was natural and just. Accordingly, they justified the distinction between freeman and slave, on which their own freedom depended, by appealing to the idea that the slave was by nature inferior to the freeman and therefore fit only to be a slave. This idea was, of course, nothing but the reflection in their minds of the reality of slavery, but to them the reality appeared to derive from the idea. In such inversions, expressing the 'false consciousness' of class society, we see the roots of philosophical idealism.</p>

On the other hand, if we consider money, its existence implies a definite stage in the exchange of commodities....

The historical conditions of its existence are by no means given with the mere circulation of money and commodities. It can spring into life only when the owner of the means of production and subsistence meets in the market with the free labourer selling his labour-power. And this one historical condition comprises a world's history. Capital, therefore, announces from its first appearance a new epoch in the process of social production. (C 1.170.)</p>
          <p id="p_000364" smilref="Capitalism_and_After__The_Ri00001.smil#p_000364">These conditions were created by the process known as 'primitive accumulation.' The necessary supply of capital and labour was obtained by robbery.</p>

These idyllic proceedings are the chief momenta of primitive accumulation. (C 1.751.)</p>
          <p id="p_000367" smilref="Capitalism_and_After__The_Ri00001.smil#p_000367">In the sixteenth century, the gold and silver circulating in Europe increased as a result of the discovery of richer and more easily worked mines in America, Hence, the value of gold and silver fell in relation to other commodities. The workers received the same amount of coined silver for their labour-power as before. The money-price of their labour remained the same. And yet their wages had fallen, for in exchange for the same quantity of silver they received a smaller amount of other commodities. This was one of the circumstances that furthered the growth of capital and I he rise of the bourgeoisie in the sixteenth century. (ME 1.164.)</p>
          <p id="p_000368" smilref="Capitalism_and_After__The_Ri00001.smil#p_000368">On the other hand, wage-labour was made available by the expropriation of the peasantry. This was done in various ways. In England, during the boom in the wool trade, large tracts of arable land were turned over to pasture, and thousands of peasant families were driven from the land. Later, the expropriation was continued by means of the Enclosure Acts. The open fields, hitherto cultivated in</p>

We have seen how the forcible usurpation of this, generally accompanied by the turning of arable into pasture land, begins at the end of the fifteenth and extends into the sixteenth century. But at that time the process was carried on by means of individual acts of violence, against which, for a hundred and fifty years, legislation fought in vain. The advance made by the eighteenth century shows itself in this, that the law itself now becomes the instrument for the theft of the people's land--although the large farmers make use of their little independent methods as well. The parliamentary form of the robbery is that of acts for enclosures of commons--in other words, decrees by which the landlords grant themselves the people's land as private property, decrees for the expropriation of the people. (C 1.724.)</p>

Thus, the merchant sets to work a number of spinners and weavers, who formerly engaged in these activities as subsidiary occupations to their agricultural work, and turns a subsidiary occupation into a principal one; after which he has them under his control and sway as wage-labourers. The next step is to remove them from their homes and assemble them in a single house of labour.

This is, in fact, the historical achievement of the capitalist system--to develop the productive forces to the point at which it becomes itself the sole obstacle to their further development. The characteristic unit of capitalist production is the factory, in which labour is mechanised and collective. Factory production was preceded by manufacture, which in turn was developed from the handicrafts. In manufacture, a number of formerly independent craftsmen are brought together to co-operate in the production of some composite article. For example, working under the same roof, the joiner, wheelwright, upholsterer and painter produce a carriage. Or alternatively, as in paper manufacture, the raw material passes through the hands of a succession of workmen, each of whom applies to it his special kind of labour. In both cases a number of separate labourers combine to form, as it were, a single collective labourer. In this way the necessary labour-time is shortened, with a corresponding reduction in the value of labour-power:</p>
          <p id="p_000381" smilref="Capitalism_and_After__The_Ri00001.smil#p_000381">In so far as such a manufacture, when first started, combines scattered handicrafts, it lessens the space by which the various phases of production are separated from each other. The time taken in passing from one stage to another is shortened, so is the labour that effectuates this passage. In comparison with a handicraft, productive power is gained, and this gain is owing to the general co-operative character of manufacture. (C 1.344.)</p>

There, the movements of the instruments of labour proceed from him; here, it is the movements of the machine that he must follow. In manufacture the workmen are parts of a living mechanism; in the factory we have a lifeless mechanism independent of the workman, who becomes its mere living appendage.... At the same time as it exhausts the nervous system to the uttermost, factory work does away with the many-sided play of the muscles and confiscates every atom of freedom in both bodily and intellectual activity. Even the lightening of the labour becomes a sort of torture, since the machine does not free the labourer from work but deprives the work of all interest. Every kind of capitalist production, in so far as it is not only a labour-process but also a process of producing surplus value, has this in common, that it is not the workman that employs the instruments of labour but the instruments of labour that employ the workman; but it is only in the factory system that this inversion acquires for the first time technical and palpable reality. By means of its conversion into an automaton, the instrument of labour confronts the labourer, during the labour-process, in the shape of capital, of dead labour, which dominates and pumps dry living labour-power. The separation of the intellectual powers of production from the manual labour, and the conversion of those powers into the might of capital over labour, is, as we have already shown, completed by modern industry erected on the foundation of machinery.

As soon as the handling of this tool becomes the work of a machine, then, together with the use-value, the exchange-value, too, of the workman's labour-power vanishes; the workman becomes unsaleable, like paper money thrown out of currency by legal enactment. That portion of the working class, thus by machinery rendered superfluous--that is, no longer immediately necessary for the self-expansion of capital--either goes to the wall in the unequal contest of the old handicrafts and manufactures with machinery, or else floods all the more easily accessible branches of industry, swamps the labour market, and sinks the price of labour-power below its value.

Each produces for himself, with the means of production that happen to be at his disposal and in order to satisfy his individual needs through the medium of exchange. No one knows how much of the article he produces is coming on to the market, or how much demand there is for it; no one knows whether his individual product will meet a real need, whether he will cover his costs, or even be able to sell it at all. Anarchy reigns in social production.

This will give him an advantage over his competitors, but sooner or later one or another of them will install an even better machine and so gain a similar advantage over him. They are all driven by competition to expand production. By so doing, however, they succeed only in renewing the competition at a higher level. At each stage, as they install new machinery, they increase the ratio of constant to variable capital; and, as was shown in Chapter III, it is the latter that is the source of surplus value. The result is that the rate of profit tends to fall.</p>
          <p id="p_000407" smilref="Capitalism_and_After__The_Ri00001.smil#p_000407">This contradiction is inherent in the nature of capitalist production. The superiority of the capitalist mode of production over earlier modes lies precisely in this, that the productivity of labour is increased by the application of machinery to the labour process; but, in the conditions of capitalist production, this can only be done by increasing the ratio of constant to variable capital, with the result that the rate of profit tends to fall (C 3.209). This is the ineradicable contradiction which drives the capitalist system forward, compelling it to expand production.</p>
          <p id="p_000408" smilref="Capitalism_and_After__The_Ri00001.smil#p_000408">Within the factory the capitalist plans his operations with great care so as to meet his production target at the minimum cost. For this purpose he must have available at each stage the requisite supplies of raw materials and machinery, including replacements and spare parts. These are his 'means of production.' If they are not available as and when required, production will be interrupted and he will incur a loss. But these means of production are themselves commodities, produced by other capitalists in similar conditions and subject to similar uncertainties. And at the end of it all he puts his goods up for sale without knowing what price they will fetch. No matter how well it may be planned within the factory, capitalist production begins and ends in the market, where anarchy prevails.</p>

But in practice such a balance is unattainable, because the relation between production and consumption is determined blindly by the operation of market forces. Disparities are constantly arising between the two spheres, between different sectors of each sphere, and within each sector. In some sectors there will be over-production, with the result that prices will fall, and some firms will be forced out of business; in other sectors there will be under-production, which will attract fresh capital, until that movement too leads to overproduction. The free movement of capital tends, it is true, to equalise the rate of profit over the whole range of industrial production (C 3.170-7), but the rate of profit still tends to fall. Further, underlying these there is a still deeper contradiction-the disparity between industry and agriculture, corresponding to the division between town and country, which is a permanent feature of capitalist society (LCW 22.94). All these factors make for instability.</p>

But by so doing they reduce the purchasing power of those who, together with their families, make up the bulk of the population; and so they restrict the market for their goods. This contradiction is only intensified by their endeavors to escape from it; and, since it lies beyond their control, it breaks out from time to time and resolves itself by means of a violent convulsion:</p>

That which is now to be expropriated is no longer the labourer working for himself, but the capitalist exploiting many labourers. This expropriation is accomplished by the action of the laws immanent in capitalist production itself, by the centralisation of capital. One capitalist always kills many.

The monopoly of capital becomes a fetter on the mode of production, which has sprung up and flourished along with it and under it. The centralisation of the means of production and the socialisation of labour at last reach a point at which they become incompatible with their capitalist integument.

          <p id="p_000441" smilref="Capitalism_and_After__The_Ri00001.smil#p_000441">In the social production of their life, men enter into definite relations that are indispensable and independent of their will, relations of production which correspond to a definite stage in the development of their material productive forces. The sum-total of these relations of production constitutes the economic structure of society, the real foundation, on which arises a legal and political superstructure, and to which correspond definite forms of social consciousness. The mode of production of material life conditions the social, political and intellectual life process in general. It is not the consciousness of men that determines their being, but, on the contrary, it is their social being that determines their consciousness. (ME 1.503.)</p>
          <p id="p_000442" smilref="Capitalism_and_After__The_Ri00001.smil#p_000442">From this it follows that the extent to which man is capable of understanding his social relations depends on the complexity of those relations as determined by his development of the productive forces. His understanding can never be complete, for that would imply the total separation of subject and object, but it is a goal which he is constantly approaching in the course of his social and intellectual advancement:</p>

The materialist dialectics of Marx and Engels certainly does contain relativism, that is, it recognises the relativity of all our knowledge, not in the sense of the denial of objective truth, but in the sense of the historically conditional nature of the limits of the approximation of our knowledge to that truth.

What actually happens is that man's knowledge is verified only when he achieves the anticipated results in the process of social practice (material production, class struggle or scientific experiment). If a man wants to succeed in his work, that is, to achieve the anticipated results, he must bring his ideas into correspondence with the laws of the objective external world; if they do not correspond, he will fail in his practice.

All scientists recognise the objectivity of natural phenomena, yet many bourgeois scientists remain blind to the existence of historical laws. They regard their social relations, not as having been formed historically in the course of the class struggle, but as having been fixed more or less permanently in conformity with human nature or some other supposedly 'natural' necessity; and by this they mean, not the nature known to them as scientists, but an idealist conception of nature as something transcendental, not far removed from the supernatural.</p>

With the development of production, leading to the division between mental and manual labour, the two spheres were distinguished as interdependent parts of a single whole, which was directed by God through the person of the king; and the good government of society was believed to be necessary for the proper functioning of the natural order. These ideas, centred in the kingship, have persisted right down to modern times. In feudal Europe the privileged status of the ruling class, headed by the king, was believed to be a permanent feature of the universe as ordained by God. It was only with the rise of the modern bourgeoisie that the idea of the class struggle as a historical process began to emerge, and even then the new class rallied the masses to its side by appealing in its turn to the eternal principles of 'natural'justice.</p>
          <p id="p_000451" smilref="Capitalism_and_After__The_Ri00001.smil#p_000451">Illusions of this kind belong to the 'common forms or general ideas* that are characteristic of all stages of class society (ME I. 1 26), but their particular form varies from one stage to another. It is in this sense that Marx speaks of 'the illusion of the epoch' (Gl 51).</p>
          <p id="p_000452" smilref="Capitalism_and_After__The_Ri00001.smil#p_000452">Each epoch of class society has fostered a new illusion, corresponding to the new stage in the class struggle. This illusion pervades the entire world outlook of the class in question, not merely its consciousness of its social relations. In each epoch the ruling class imagines its position in society to be determined by the laws of nature. Thus, in ancient Greece, slavery was justified by Aristotle on the ground that the slave is naturally inferior to the freeman; and similarly, in the teaching of Pythagoras, body and soul were regarded as standing to one another in the relation of slave and master. In feudal Europe, serfdom was justified by John of Salisbury on the ground that 'according to the law of the universe all things are not reduced to order equally and immediately, but the lowest through the intermediate and the intermediate through the higher.' Similarly, in medieval theology, God sits enthroned at the summit of a hierarchy of archangels, angels, men, beasts and plants, all of which occupy the place assigned to them at the creation.</p>

It was Ricardo, following Adam Smith, who enunciated the labour theory of value, yet, although he recognised the existence of class antagonisms, he regarded them as natural and therefore eternal (C. 1.14). It was left to Marx and Engels, the founders of scientific socialism, to bring the class struggle into the full light of history.</p>

While society became more and more bourgeois, the state order remained feudal. Large-scale trade--that is, international and, even more, world trade--requires free commodity-owners, unrestricted in their movements and possessing equal rights as traders to exchange their commodities on the basis of laws that are equal for all of them, at least in each separate place. The transition from handicraft to manufacture presupposes the existence of a number of free workers--free, on the one hand, from the fetters of the guild, and, on the other, from the means whereby they could use their labour-power themselves; free to contract with their employers for the hire of</p>

            <span class="text" id="span_000148">labour, found its unconscious but clearest expression in the law of value of modern bourgeois economics, according to which the value of a commodity is measured by the socially necessary labour embodied in it. But, where economic relations required freedom and equality of rights, the political system opposed them at every step with guild restrictions and special privileges. Local privileges, differential duties, exceptional laws of all kinds affected in trading not only foreigners or people living in the colonies, but also, often enough, whole categories of each country's nationals. The privileges of the guilds everywhere and ever anew formed barriers obstructing the development of manufacture. (AD 118.)</span>

          <p id="p_000462" smilref="Capitalism_and_After__The_Ri00001.smil#p_000462">The demand for liberation from feudal bonds and for the institution of equal rights through the abolition of feudal inequalities was bound to assume a wider scope as soon as the economic advance of society placed it on the order of the day. If it was raised in the interests of industry and trade, it was also necessary to demand the same equality for the great mass of the peasantry, who, in every degree of bondage from total serfdom upwards, were compelled to give the greater part of their labour-time without payment to their feudal lord and in addition to render innumerable other dues to him and to the state. At the same time it was impossible to avoid demanding the abolition of feudal privileges, of the freedom from taxation enjoyed by the nobility, of the political privileges enjoyed by the various feudal estates. And, since people were no longer living in a world empire, such as the Roman Empire had been, but in a system of independent states, which dealt with each other on equal terms and at approximately the same degree of bourgeois development, it was a matter of course that the demand for equality should assume a general character reaching</p>

All over Western Europe, the attack on the economic and political privileges of the medieval Church was driven home by the propagation of new doctrines proclaiming freedom of conscience and the virtues of toleration, industry and thrift. By repudiating the authority of the Pope the Protestants asserted the religious independence of the bourgeoisie. The English Revolution was fought out in the name of a religious conflict between Puritanism and the established Church. Later still, the philosophers of the Enlightenment, prophets of the French Revolution, made a frontal assault on all the strongholds of feudal ideology, including religion itself:</p>

They recognised no external authority of any kind. Religion, concepts of nature, society, political systems-- everything was subjected to the most merciless criticism, everything had to justify itself at the bar of reason or renounce all claim to existence. The reasoning intellect was applied to everything as the sole measure.... All previous forms of society and government, all the old ideas handed down by tradition, were flung into the lumber-room as irrational. The world had hitherto allowed itself to be guided solely by prejudices; everything in the past deserved only pity and contempt. Now for the first time appeared the light of day; henceforth, superstition, injustice, privilege and oppression were to be superseded by eternal truth, eternal justice, equality grounded in nature and the inalienable rights of man.

          <p id="p_000468" smilref="Capitalism_and_After__The_Ri00001.smil#p_000468">We know today that this kingdom of reason was nothing more than the idealised kingdom of the bourgeoisie, that eternal justice found its realisation in bourgeois justice, that equality reduced itself to bourgeois equality before the law; that bourgeois property was proclaimed as one of the essential rights of man; and that the government of reason, the Social Contract of Rousseau, came into being, and could only come into being, as a bourgeois-democratic republic. No more than their predecessors could the great thinkers of the eighteenth century transcend the limits imposed on them by their own epoch. (AD 24.)</p>

Far from welcoming the French Revolution, which had as its declared aim the realisation of those ideals, the leaders of the English bourgeoisie saw in it a threat, not so much to feudal privilege (which they had already abolished) as to bourgeois property. A similar change took place after the Revolution in France itself. In both countries the bourgeois ideologists were forced on to the defensive. The change was particularly striking in the sphere of economic theory:</p>
          <p id="p_000470" smilref="Capitalism_and_After__The_Ri00001.smil#p_000470">In France and in England the bourgeoisie had conquered political power. Thenceforth, the struggle, practically as well as theoretically, took on more and more outspoken and threatening forms. It sounded the knell of scientific bourgeois economy. Henceforth, it was no longer a question whether this theorem or that was true, but whether it was useful to capital or harmful, expedient or inexpedient, politically dangerous or not. In place of disinterested enquires there were hired prize fighters; in place of genuine scientific research, the evil intent of apologetics. (C 1.15.)</p>

The ideals of liberty and equality were interpreted, not as freedom from oppression, freedom to work together for the good of humanity, but as freedom to compete with others on equal terms in pursuit of one's private interests. Bourgeois property, the foundation of civilised life, was a privilege from which the poor were to be excluded; and poverty was seen, not as the travail of a new society, but as a permanent necessity.</p>
          <p id="p_000473" smilref="Capitalism_and_After__The_Ri00001.smil#p_000473">According to Malthus, the inevitability of poverty arises from the natural growth of population, which will always outrun the means of subsistence. Endeavours to relieve the hardships of the poor are misguided, because, left to itself, their struggle to live is conducive to the survival of the fittest (EPM 199-205), In these ideas we recognise the germ of Darwin's theory of the origin of species, and when on this basis he had revolutionised the science of biology, the bourgeois economists acclaimed his theories as a final proof that the poverty of the workers was a law of nature (DN 208).</p>
          <p id="p_000474" smilref="Capitalism_and_After__The_Ri00001.smil#p_000474">According to Malthus, the wages which the manufacturer pays to his workers must conform to the law of supply and demand, which represents 'the ratio of population to capital.' It is his duty to run his business so as to extract the highest profit, for in this way he contributes to the wealth of the nation and provides employment for the labouring poor. The function of the state is to safeguard the rights of property and so ensure the due observance of all contracts, between one employer and another and between employer and employed. It was recognised that these conditions bore hardly on those who had no property, and among the radicals there were some who looked forward to the time when all the king's subjects might enjoy political rights.

They contract as free agents, and the agreement they come to is but the form in which they give legal expression to their common will. Equality, because each enters into relation with the other as with a simple owner of commodities, and they exchange equivalent for equivalent. Property, because each disposes only of what is his own. And Bentham, because each looks only to himself. The only force that brings them together and puts them in relation to each other is the selfishness, the gain, and the private interests of each. Each looks to himself only, and no one troubles himself about the rest; and just because they do so, so do they all, in accordance with the pre-established harmony of things, or under the auspices of an all-shrewd providence, work together for their mutual advantage, for the common weal, and for the interest of all.

The masses of the people were excluded from the franchise on the ground that they were fit only to be governed, not to govern, as in the remarks quoted above from Edmund Burke, who belonged to the ruling class of that day.

The agitation for reform was then taken up by the Chartists, who, supported by mass meetings all over the country, submitted to parliament a petition calling for equal electoral districts, abolition of the property qualification for members of parliament, universal manhood suffrage, annual parliaments, vote by ballot, and payment for members of parliament. If these demands had been granted, the workers, who constituted the vast majority of the population, would have been able to take power; but they were resisted for that reason by the bourgeoisie. The Government called in the army and the police, and the Chartist movement was crushed. Even the bourgeois radicals, who were in favour of parliamentary reforms, shrank from the idea of their being used as an instrument of working-class power.</p>

The 'democratic socialism' of Labour Party spokesmen, implying that socialism can be won through parliamentary reforms, is bourgeois democracy under another name. The Labour Party has thus become a mainstay of capitalism; for, so long as the country is governed by one or other of two parties, both pledged to work within the system, the ruling class is secure. This becomes clear when we consider another aspect of the system.</p>
          <p id="p_000495" smilref="Capitalism_and_After__The_Ri00001.smil#p_000495">In the years 1823-30 the criminal code was revised, and a new police force was created, replacing the medieval night-watchmen. In 1870-71 the army and the civil service were reorganised in such a way as to place the executive arm of the state machine--that is, the police, the armed forces, the judiciary and the bureaucracy--under the control of the new bourgeoisie. Since then there has been a continuous increase in the power of the executive at the expense of Parliament, whose functions are purely legislative and deliberative. In theory, the sovereignty of Parliament, elected by the people, is supreme: in practice, it is severely limited. The election pledges on the strength of which a party wins its majority are not binding either on the deputies or on the government, and there is no provision for the recall of deputies. Within Parliament, the real power rests, not with the deputies, but with the Cabinet, whose members depend for advice on senior civil service officials, trained and trusted servants of the ruling class, not subject to election at all. And even within the Cabinet itself there is a small group of leading members--the inner Cabinet--who in times of crisis take vital decisions in consultation with the bankers and other monopoly capitalists. This is where state power really lies. In this way, supported by the mass media, which are designed to befuddle the minds of the people by trivialising and sensationalising all serious issues, our rulers are able to maintain their</p>

Naturally, so long as the people remain docile, they prefer to rule in this way; but, as soon as there arises a popular movement strong enough to challenge their economic privileges, then, raising a hue and cry about the threat to 'law and order,' they abolish their parliamentary liberties and install an open dictatorship.</p>

There is not a single state, however democratic, which has no loopholes or reservations in the constitution guaranteeing to the bourgeoisie the possibility of dispatching troops against the workers, of proclaiming martial law, and so forth, in case of a 'violation of public order'-- actually, in case the exploited class 'violates' its slave status and tries to behave unslavishly.

Their insurrections did much to weaken the feudal system, and so prepared the way for the bourgeois revolution, but the leadership of that revolution did not rest with them. Despite these limitations, some of their leaders, notably Thomas Muenzer in Germany and Gerrard Winstanley in England, were able to foresee dimly the nature of that further revolution, still in the distant future, which would bring exploitation to an end. Muenzer (1488-1525) declared that God's kingdom was to be established on earth, not in heaven, and that it would be founded on common property and social equality. Winstanley was the leader of the Diggers, a small band of dispossessed peasants, who in the spring of 1649 dug up the wasteland on St. George's Hill in Surrey with the intention of starting a communist colony. The attempt was, of course, a failure--one of many such failures through which the proletariat was eventually to find the path to revolution; but even so Winstanley had an intuitive grasp of the labour theory of value:</p>

In communist society that lost unity will be restored through the gradual abolition of commodity production. In the intermediate stage of socialism, which marks the transition from capitalism to communism, the products of labour are still exchanged, but only within certain limits, which preclude the appropriation of surplus value, and so the exchange approximates more and more closely to a simple exchange of equal values. Further, in consequence of these economic changes, the social relations between individuals are gradually reorganised on the basis of true equality. This has been shown by Marx in his analysis of the process by which wage-labour is transformed and eventually abolished after the socialist revolution in the transition to communism.</p>

In all stages of class society the working woman is doubly exploited, both as a worker and as a woman (LCW 32.161). Even after the proletarian revolution, which abolishes economic and legal inequalities between men and women, there still remains the need for the ideological remoulding of both sexes, but more particularly of the men (LCW 32.162).

(ME 3.19.)</p>
          <p id="p_000560" smilref="Capitalism_and_After__The_Ri00001.smil#p_000560">Thus, the transition from socialism to communism requires a sufficient development of the productive forces and of the individual producers to provide material abundance for all and to ensure man's final emancipation from the ideological limitations of class society.</p>

This is a necessary condition for the development of capitalist production and therefore for the very existence of the bourgeoisie: 'The first birthright of capital is the</p>

In reality, therefore, since the relation between capital and labour is inherently unequal, bourgeois equality resolves itself into the equal rights enjoyed by the capitalists among themselves; and, as the competition between them becomes more intense--as 'one capitalist kills many'--even these rights are in practice curtailed, until eventually they are reduced to the right of the multinational tycoons to pillage the 'free world.'</p>

In ancient and medieval society, based on slavery or serfdom, its development was restricted by the relatively low level of the productive forces, but in modern capitalist society, based on wage-labour, it has come to its full growth and established its supremacy over older modes of production all over the world.</p>

These are the basic tenets of scientific socialism. The question arises, to what extent have they been confirmed by the actual experience of socialist construction? That question will be discussed later. In the present chapter we shall examine the Chinese people's commune, as it has evolved since the revolution of 1949. This is a socialist unit of a new type, which embodies in its structure successive stages in the transition from private to collective ownership and is still developing.</span>

          <p id="p_000569" smilref="Capitalism_and_After__The_Ri00001.smil#p_000569">It was the universal opinion among bourgeois experts in 1949 that, since the country was dependent on imported food, the new Chinese government would be unable to survive except by coming to terms with the U.S.A. This opinion, which has been contradicted so sharply by the event, reflects the inability of bourgeois economists to understand the interdependence of economics and politics. The economic life of backward countries is dominated by a surplus of labour and a shortage of capital. The capitalist solution of this problem is to introduce foreign capital, but, far from providing a solution, this only aggravates the problem, and therefore these economists regard it as insoluble. But capital is accumulated value, and value is created by labour. Therefore, if only the surplus labour could be deployed so as to make good the shortage of capital, the contradiction would be resolved. This can be done, but only on one condition, which is political, not economic. Those who provide the labour must be convinced that the value which they are asked to create will belong to them and not to any capitalist, native or foreign. In other words, the contradiction is resolved under the dictatorship of the proletariat. Having seized power, the workers and peasants bring the entire process of production and consumption under their unified control.</p>
          <p id="p_000570" smilref="Capitalism_and_After__The_Ri00001.smil#p_000570">Turning back to Marx's observations on the transition between capitalism and communism, we find that they need to be amplified at two important points. In the first place, he did not allow for the emergence of collective ownership as an intermediate stage between private and state ownership in the socialisation of agriculture. This point (which was foreseen by Engels, writing after Marx's death) will be discussed in the next chapter. In the second place, in his remarks on the income and expenditure of a socialist state, he did not take account of the needs of national defence. It must be remembered that he expected the first proletarian revolution to be carried through simultaneously in the advanced countries of the West (ME 1.91). In the event, it took place in Russia, the most backward country in Europe; then it spread to China, which was even more backward than Russia; and in both it met with armed opposition from the West. The builders of socialism in Russia and China had to start, not from an advanced capitalist economy, but in far more difficult conditions, due to their own economic backwardness and the hostility of the capitalist world.</p>

          <p id="p_000572" smilref="Capitalism_and_After__The_Ri00001.smil#p_000572">There can be no socialism without heavy industry, which provides the machinery required for the development of light industry and the mechanisation of agriculture. At the same time, every economic system depends on agriculture for providing the entire population with the basic means of subsistence, and, as industry expands, so the demand for agricultural products increases. Hence heavy industry and agriculture must be developed in such a way as to become mutually supporting. This can be done with light industry as the link. The development of heavy industry requires the investment of large sums on a long-term basis. Light industry requires less capital and brings a quicker return. Therefore, light industry can be developed as a means of accumulating the capital required for the development of heavy industry. It can also be used to assist agriculture both by creating a demand for industrial crops and by supplying the agricultural population with consumer goods. Thus, while heavy industry remains the core of socialist construction, it is helped, and not hindered, by the parallel development of light industry and agriculture:</p>
          <p id="p_000573" smilref="Capitalism_and_After__The_Ri00001.smil#p_000573">As agriculture and light industry develop, heavy industry, assured of its market and funds, will grow faster.

          <p id="p_000574" smilref="Capitalism_and_After__The_Ri00001.smil#p_000574">In the years immediately following liberation, agriculture was almost the sole source of capital accumulation, because at that time there was scarcely any modern industry at all. Since then the output of grain has more than doubled, while the output of steel has risen from 158,000 tons in 1949 to 23,000,000 tons in 1972. Thanks to the increase in the volume of agricultural production, it has been possible to reduce the rate of the state tax on grain, which now averages about six per cent. The remainder of the surplus produced by the peasants is purchased from them by the state.</p>

          <p id="p_000578" smilref="Capitalism_and_After__The_Ri00001.smil#p_000578">The land reform had been carried out in the liberated areas before 1949, and was extended to the rest of the country in the years 1949-52. The land was divided among the peasantry on the principle that it should belong to those who tilled it. This marked the completion of the bourgeois-democratic revolution in the countryside. The question then arose, was agriculture to be collectivised on a capitalist or a socialist basis? It was argued by Liu Shao-chi, with the support of the rich and upper-middle peasants, that collectivisation was impossible without mechanisation, and must therefore wait until industry was ready to supply the necessary machines. In the meantime, agriculture was to be developed on a capitalist basis, with a free market for farm produce and the right to employ wage-labour and to buy and sell land. To this policy, however, the poor peasants, who formed the majority of the rural population, were firmly opposed; and accordingly, with their support, Mao Tse-tung put forward the line of step-by-step advance to socialism, beginning with collectivisation and deferring mechanisation till a later stage. This line was designed to ensure the active co-operation of the peasants by giving them the opportunity of confirming its correctness from their own experience:</p>
          <p id="p_000579" smilref="Capitalism_and_After__The_Ri00001.smil#p_000579">Chairman Mao has taught us: 'the method we are using in the socialist transformation of agriculture is one of 'step-by-step advance.' The advantage of this method is that 'it is possible for the peasants to raise their socialist consciousness gradually through their personal experience and gradually to change their mode of life, thus lessening any feeling of abrupt change.' (PR 70-7.5.)</p>
          <p id="p_000580" smilref="Capitalism_and_After__The_Ri00001.smil#p_000580">The stages of collectivisation were four: (I) the mutual-aid team, based on private ownership, but containing some rudiments of socialism; (2) the elementary co-operative, which was semi-socialist, though retaining some elements of private ownership: (3) the advanced co-operative, which was fully collective; and (4) the people's</p>

The last stage marks the completion of the socialist revolution in the countryside. As we shall see later, there still survives an element of private ownership, but so small as to be no more than a vestige from the past.</p>
          <p id="p_000582" smilref="Capitalism_and_After__The_Ri00001.smil#p_000582">The mutual-aid team was accepted all the more readily, because the custom of mutual assistance in various forms was a very ancient one (PR 63-44.8), being derived from the solidarity of the primitive clan. The clan basis of village life--organised before liberation under the landlord's control-was still a living reality (MSW 1.93); and therefore, after expelling the landlords, it was an easy step for the villagers, under the leadership of the peasants' association, to reorganise themselves as a mutual-aid team. Each family had its own holding and its own draft animals and implements; but they cultivated their holdings collectively, and this enabled them to increase their output. They paid a tax in kind to the state and sold to the state any surplus left over after meeting their own needs. In time they introduced some simple divisions of labour and accumulated small amounts of collective property. In this way there arose a contradiction between collective labour and individual management.</p>
          <p id="p_000583" smilref="Capitalism_and_After__The_Ri00001.smil#p_000583">The transition from the mutual-aid team to the elementary cooperative took place in the years 1953-55. There was no change in the system of ownership, but the whole area was now cultivated under unified management. After paying the agricultural tax, the net income was divided into two parts. Each family received a land payment proportionate to the size of its holding, and the rest--the greater part--was distributed as wages. Each member's wage was determined by the quantity and quality of the work done, in accordance with the socialist principle 'from each according to his ability, to each according to his work.' Output increased, because with unified management it became possible to organise the farm work more effectively. In this way there arose a contradiction between unified management and multiple ownership.</p>

The income was divided as follows. After handing over what was due by tax or sale to the state, and defraying the costs of production and management, a portion was set aside as a contribution to a reserve fund and a public welfare fund. The remainder was then distributed as wages. The reserve fund was used for reinvestment and for emergencies, the public welfare fund for assisting the aged and infirm and giving help to large families short of farm hands.</p>
          <p id="p_000586" smilref="Capitalism_and_After__The_Ri00001.smil#p_000586">Meanwhile the productive forces were developing so rapidly that within the space of a few years even the advanced co-operative became inadequate.

They were formed by the amalgamation of neighbouring co-operatives in order to undertake large-scale projects such as flood control, water conservancy, afforestation, fisheries, and transport. In addition, many communes set up their own factories for making tractors, chemical fertilisers, and other means of production. The development of local industry served several purposes-- to provide employment for the farm-workers during the slack season; to absorb labour displaced by mechanisation; and to make the rural areas more self-sufficient, less dependent on the central government. This last point has a special importance for national defence. Every commune has its own people's militia, trained in guerrilla warfare by resident units of the People's Liberation Army; and at the same time the P.L.A. unit provides a skilled labour force ready to participate in all branches of production. There are over 70,000 communes, covering the whole of rural China. They vary greatly in size, physical conditions and economic level; but their structure is in general the same. Each commune consists of so many production brigades, and each production brigade of so many production teams. Thus, to cite a typical instance, a</p>

It contains 23 production brigades and 81 production teams, with a total population of 21,000 persons, divided into 4,100 households.</p>
          <p id="p_000590" smilref="Capitalism_and_After__The_Ri00001.smil#p_000590">The production team has its own land, draft animals and implements. It has the use of small machines and repair shops owned by the brigade and of larger machines owned by the commune. It elects its own leaders, keeps its own accounts, and organises its own distribution. The members divide their income annually. First, they set aside the sums required to defray the costs of production and management, to pay the state tax, and to deliver the surplus grain which it has been agreed to sell to the state. (The state tax is subject to readjustment from time to time, and may be reduced in the event of crop failures due to natural causes.) The net income is then divided as follows. One portion goes to the reserve and development fund, another to the welfare fund, and the remainder--70-75 per cent--is distributed as wages. When the team meets to fix wage rates, each member in turn puts forward his evaluation of his own work. This is then discussed with him by the others, with attention to both quantity and quality, and finally assessed at so many 'work points.' The differential is not large and is tending to diminish. The administrative workers are paid at the same rates. They are all obliged to do some manual work, and their wages are calculated on the basis of the work points they have earned when working in the fields. In addition to his wages in cash, each member receives a free supply of grain, vegetables, salt and firewood.</p>

It is also permitted to cultivate a small allotment as a spare-time occupation. These plots are used for growing vegetables or breeding pigs or poultry.

The plots are held on condition that priority is given to work in the collective. They are strictly limited in size according to the size of the family, and make up altogether not more than six or seven per cent of the area under cultivation.

The plan commune is part of the plan for the province, and that in turn is part of the state plan for the country whole. The prices of agricultural produce are agreed in advance between the commune and the state, and adjusted when necessary in favour of the commune. Thus, if there is a glut, the state buys the crop at the agreed price and sells it at a lower price. In this way the producers are protected against fluctuations of supply and demand. Part of the surplus may also be sold to commercial communes, but there is no market in which goods can be sold at speculative prices and no scope for commercial competition between communes or for private profiteering of any kind. In return, the state provides the commune with machinery and manufactured consumer goods. It is state policy to supply agricultural machinery below the cost of production in order to reduce the gap in productivity between agriculture and industry.</p>

As such, it is an instrument of proletarian dictatorship, ready to defend the revolution against all enemies, internal or external; and at the same time it is genuinely democratic, since it brings all spheres of economic and social life under unified popular control.</p>
          <p id="p_000600" smilref="Capitalism_and_After__The_Ri00001.smil#p_000600">If the function of the people's commune is to effect the transition from small-scale to large-scale agriculture, why, it may be asked, is it based on so small a unit as the production team? The answer is that it is through the production team, as it has evolved out of the mutual-aid team, that the peasants have been introduced step by step to the advantages of large-scale production. Thus, meeting together as members of the production team, they decide on their own initiative to set aside a portion of their income as a contribution to the welfare fund. They do this knowing that it will be used to ensure that the aged and infirm will always be provided for. Accordingly, when they meet as members of the commune to discuss proposals for some hydro-electric scheme, which when completed will irrigate the whole valley, they support it in the confident belief that it will bring lasting benefits, if not to them, to their children. This is socialist democracy, in which, as Lenin said, the whole is organised for the 'democratic administration leans of production' (LCW 23.25).</p>

It grew sharper whenever the revolution took a step forward, whenever we were hit by natural calamities or came up against other difficulties, or wherever the localities went wrong in their work. The landlords and rich peasants would manoeuvre and pull strings from behind the scenes, some of the well-to-do middle peasants, who had worst capitalist inclinations, would come out into open, clamouring to withdraw from the co-operative and work their land on their own. They would go in for speculation and cornering on the local rural markets, and for hiring farm hands and setting themselves up as money-lenders--all in an attempt to smash the collective economy. They would adopt the tactics of worming their way into leading positions and bribing cadres in order to usurp the leadership of the collective economy and adulterate its character. Such a sharp class struggle inevitably reflects itself inside the Party. At such a time, unstable Party members, ideologically unprepared for the socialist revolution, would waver on the question of agricultural collectivisation....</p>

Although the poor and lower-middle peasants of the land reform period have been enjoying considerable improvements in their livelihood for the last ten years or so, they owe this common prosperity to their collective economy. They know what it was like to be exploited, and they appreciate the benefits of collectivisation. Therefore, the former poor -and lower-middle peasants, with the exception of a handful of degenerates who have forgotten about the bitter past, remain to this day the really reliable force in the countryside.

The collectivisation of agriculture in the Soviet Union was carried out under Stalin's leadership, and he too followed the Leninist line; but it was done in the face of great difficulties, due mainly to the pressure of capitalist encirclement. The result was that the worker-peasant alliance was not consolidated so firmly as in China. This strengthened the position of the bourgeoisie. After Stalin's death, the dictatorship of the proletariat, on which the worker-peasant alliance depends, was formally abandoned. During the ensuing years there were shortfalls in all the main branches of agricultural production, attributed by the Party to technical and administrative defects. These defects, manifested in a vast outgrowth of bureaucracy, are real enough, but they are only symptoms. Under the present leadership, the bourgeois line has prevailed over the proletarian line; the initiative in the class struggle has passed from the proletariat to the bourgeoisie. Consequently, the collective farms have lost their socialist orientation.</p>

The production team is merely a section of the labour force; it is not an accounting unit. The chairman is a state official, responsible for enforcing labour discipline, and receives a salary far in excess of the wages paid to the working members. The private plots are large, and the produce is sold on the free market.

          <p id="p_000612" smilref="Capitalism_and_After__The_Ri00001.smil#p_000612">There are two forms of socialist ownership: state ownership, also known as ownership by the whole people or all-people's ownership, and collective or co-operative ownership. The need for this distinction was foreseen by Engels:</p>

Our task in relation to the small peasant consists, in the first place, in effecting a transition from his private enterprise and private possession to co-operative enterprise and co-operative possession, only not by force, but by dint of example and the offer of social assistance for this purpose.

          <p id="p_000614" smilref="Capitalism_and_After__The_Ri00001.smil#p_000614">Thus, the function of collective ownership is to provide a bridge between private and state ownership.</p>

The proletarian has never had any interest in private ownership; he has been associated from the beginning with the development of large-scale industry; and therefore, having seized state power, he is fully prepared subjectively for state ownership. The peasant, on the other hand, is a small proprietor, still attached to a pre-capitalist mode of production; he has still to learn that small-scale production has no future; and therefore, though he has supported</p>

The cooperative policy, if successful, will result in raising the small economy and in facilitating its transition, within an indefinite period, to large-scale production on the basis of voluntary association.

This has made it possible to find a proper solution to the problem of giving unified leadership within the framework of the commune and of bringing into full play the initiative of the units which directly organise production. It is envisaged that a relatively long time will elapse before the rising level of agricultural productive forces and the further development of the economy at commune and brigade level will have created suitable conditions for making the production brigade rather than the production team the basic accounting unit. After a further period the commune will be made the basic accounting unit. (PR 64-15.20.)</p>

If timely steps are not taken to promote and complete this change, and if the existing collective ownership is kept intact in definitely, with the result that commune members confine their attention to the relatively narrow scope of the interests of their collective, the continuous development of the social productive forces and the continuous, raising of the people's political understanding will be impeded.

          <p id="p_000629" smilref="Capitalism_and_After__The_Ri00001.smil#p_000629">Resting as it does on private ownership of the means of production, commodity production must necessarily change its character when private ownership is replaced by socialist ownership. The most important change is that labour-power ceases to be a commodity. This is the feature that distinguishes the capitalist form of commodity production from all earlier forms, and now it disappears. It follows that there is no longer any scope for the appropriation of surplus value. Indeed, the very concept of surplus value, in so far as it depends on the distinction between necessary and surplus labour, or paid and unpaid labour, loses its meaning. The value which the workers create by their labour belongs now in its entirety to them, and it is for them to decide how much of it they will spend on the means of consumption and how much they will reinvest in production or set aside for other purposes.</p>
          <p id="p_000630" smilref="Capitalism_and_After__The_Ri00001.smil#p_000630">It does not follow, however, that the law of value has become obsolete. Under socialism, as distinct from communism, labour is not yet sufficiently productive to create abundance for all, and therefore it is necessary that the worker should receive from society no more than the equivalent of what he has produced. This is what is meant by the formula that he is paid 'according to his work.' His work represents a certain amount of labour expended in production; his wages represent an equal amount of labour to be expended in consumption. The two amounts can only be equated by reference to some common measure, and this is provided by the law of value. The products of labour continue to circulate as commodities, and</p>

The law is also used in the production of goods that do not circulate as commodities--for example, manufacturing machinery produced by one state-owned factory for another. For the sake of strict accounting and economy in management, it is still expedient that such goods should be costed according to the law of value. In special circumstances, of course, it may be decided that a particular product shall be sold above or below its value. In other words, the law of value is now under control, but it has not ceased to operate. This is how the matter is explained by Stalin:</p>
          <p id="p_000632" smilref="Capitalism_and_After__The_Ri00001.smil#p_000632">It is sometimes asked whether the law of value exists and operates in our country under the socialist system. Yes, it does exist and operate. Wherever commodities and commodity production exist, there the law of value must also exist. In our country, the sphere of operation of the law of value extends, first of all, to the exchange of commodities through purchase and sale-- the exchange, briefly, of articles of personal consumption. Here, in this sphere, the law of value preserves--within certain limits, of course-the function of a regulator. .</p>
          <p id="p_000633" smilref="Capitalism_and_After__The_Ri00001.smil#p_000633">But the operation of the law of value is not confined to the sphere of commodity circulation. It also extends to production. True, the law of value has no regulating function in our socialist production, but nevertheless it influences production, and this fact cannot be ignored when directing production. (EPS 23.)</p>
          <p id="p_000634" smilref="Capitalism_and_After__The_Ri00001.smil#p_000634">There are, of course, many other features of capitalist commodity production which disappear in a socialist economy. Such are the vast expenditure on advertising and other forms of sales promotion, designed not merely to keep the consumer informed about the goods available but to mislead him with false information; and the practice of 'built-in obsolescence,' that is, of producing consumer goods (such as electric light bulbs and motor-cars) in such a manner as to restrict their durability, and so to maintain a rapid turnover. Such dishonest practices, which pass as 'good business' in capitalist society, have no place in a socialist economy, in which, with the continuous rise in living standards, the demand for consumer goods is normally greater than the supply. And lastly, since the entire process of production, distribution and consumption is now under control, the possibility of</p>

          <p id="p_000636" smilref="Capitalism_and_After__The_Ri00001.smil#p_000636">Socialism, too, of course, has its internal contradictions, but these are non-antagonistic, so long as they are handled correctly. Here again, however, in the planning of production, it is necessary to take account of the law of value. To illustrate this point, let us return to the problems arising from the disparity between industry and agriculture.</p>
          <p id="p_000637" smilref="Capitalism_and_After__The_Ri00001.smil#p_000637">Broadly speaking, the prices at which the communes sell their grain to the state determine the money income of the peasants; and conversely, the prices at which the state sells the grain, measured against wage rates, determine the real income of the industrial workers. The exchanges are effected in accordance with the law of value; but, if the law were allowed to operate freely, the peasants would be at a permanent disadvantage, because, in the absence of mechanisation, agriculture is less productive than industry, and therefore wages are lower. In order to resolve this contradiction, the state regulates prices in such a way that the communes are able to sell their grain above its value or alternatively to buy machinery below its value. The aim is to increase the funds available for mechanisation and so in time to eliminate the disparity between industry and agriculture. When that gap has been closed, the distinction between the proletariat and the peasantry will disappear.</p>
          <p id="p_000638" smilref="Capitalism_and_After__The_Ri00001.smil#p_000638">Similar contradictions arise within each sector--for example, between grain production and meat production, or between different branches of industry--and others again from unpredictable factors, such as natural disasters, wars, and threats of war. In the correct handling of all these lies the secret of successful socialist planning:</p>
          <p id="p_000639" smilref="Capitalism_and_After__The_Ri00001.smil#p_000639">A constant process of readjustment through state planning is needed to deal with the contradiction between production and the needs of society, which will long remain as an objective reality. Every year our country draws up an economic plan in order to establish a proper ratio between accumulation and consumption and achieve a balance between production and needs. Balance is nothing but a temporary, relative unity of opposites. By the end of each year, this balance, taken as a whole, is upset by the struggle of opposites; the unity undergoes a change, balance becomes imbalance, unity becomes disunity, and once again it is necessary</p>

As a matter of fact, this balance, this unity is partially upset every month, or every quarter, and partial readjustments are called for. Sometimes contradictions arise and the balance is upset because our subjective arrangements do not correspond to objective reality; this is what we call making a mistake. The ceaseless emergence and ceaseless resolution of contradictions is the dialectical law of the development of things. (MFE 95.)</p>

The productive forces will have developed to the point at which, thanks to the abundance of wealth, the socialist principle, 'to each according to his work' becomes obsolete and is replaced by the communist principle, 'to each according to his needs.' When that point has been reached, the law of value will cease to operate, and the products of man's labour will no longer take the form of exchange-values, but only of use-values, to be measured directly by the amount of labour-time expended on them:</p>
          <p id="p_000642" smilref="Capitalism_and_After__The_Ri00001.smil#p_000642">In the second phase of communist society, the amount of labour expended on the production of goods will be measured, not in a roundabout way, not through value and its forms, as in the case under commodity production, but directly and immediately by the amount of time, the number of hours, expended in the production of goods. As to the distribution of labour, its distribution among the branches of production will be regulated, not by the law of value, which will have ceased to function by that time, but by the growth of society's demand for goods.

Like the communes, they are an impressive example of what is being achieved by the masses of the people in shaping their own future.</p>

And the necessary basis for this was the great division of labour between the masses discharging simple manual labour and the privileged few directing labour, conducting trade and public affairs, and at a later stage occupying themselves with art and science.

On the one hand, the national bourgeoisie, the bourgeois intellectuals, and the urban petty bourgeoisie are being encouraged to take part in manual labour with a view to overcoming their class prejudices and moving closer to the proletariat; on the other, the proletariat and the peasantry are taking over the cultural heritage of class society and adapting it to their needs, using it to remould the whole of society and remoulding themselves in the process. On both sides the movement is conducted by the conscious application of Marxism-Leninism, in which theory is united with practice.</p>
          <p id="p_000677" smilref="Capitalism_and_After__The_Ri00001.smil#p_000677">The national bourgeoisie has been won over to socialism in the same way as the peasantry. Through the system of joint factory ownership, intermediate between private and state ownership, the transition has been effected gradually and is now virtually complete. These former factory-owners have ceased to be exploiters, but in common with other members of the expropriated classes they have still to learn that exploitation is immoral. Accordingly, they are now engaged in a process of ideological remoulding, which includes participation in manual labour The factory-manager, the civil servant, the army general, the doctor, the teacher, the artist, the actor--all these are encouraged to devote a regular portion of their working time to manual tasks at their place of work or to working on the factory floor or in the fields. This gives them the first opportunity they have ever had of meeting the masses of the people on equal terms, learning to understand, to respect, and to assimilate, the new proletarian morality, which teaches that happiness is to be found, not in competition, not in the pursuit of private gain or personal prestige, but in working together for the common good. Participation in manual labour is voluntary except for Party officials and government employees, for whom it is compulsory, being regarded as a salutary reminder that they hold their positions only as servants of the people.</p>
          <p id="p_000678" smilref="Capitalism_and_After__The_Ri00001.smil#p_000678">Meanwhile, the workers and peasants are also engaged in remoulding themselves, only in them, since they already know from their own experience what it is to be exploited, the process takes a different form:</p>

          <p id="p_000679" smilref="Capitalism_and_After__The_Ri00001.smil#p_000679">In the building of a socialist society everybody needs remoulding--the exploiters and also the working people. Who says the working class does not need it? Of course, the remoulding of the exploiters is qualitatively different from that of the working people, and the two must not be confused. The working class remoulds the whole of society in class struggle and in the struggle against nature, and at the same time remoulds itself. It must ceaselessly learn in the course of its work and overcome its shortcomings step by step, and must never stop doing so. (MFE 105.)</p>
          <p id="p_000680" smilref="Capitalism_and_After__The_Ri00001.smil#p_000680">In many factories it is now a regular practice to allow the manual workers time off from the shop floor in order to participate in management; and everywhere, in the factories and in the communes, they are continuously engaged in summing up their practical experience of the struggle to increase production with the conscious aim of deepening their knowledge of the world about them and thereby extending their control over it. Having grasped the Marxist theory of knowledge, they are now, in their millions, applying it in their daily work in the factories and in the fields as an instrument of dialectical analysis. They are already reaping a rich reward in the shape of numerous innovations in the technique of engineering, plant-breeding, and other branches of production. Meanwhile, a new educational system is being constructed, in which the work of the schools and universities is integrated with productive labour so as to train a new generation of workers, who will unite manual skill with scientific knowledge in the service of the people. In this mass movement for the reunion of mental and manual labour, which is something without precedent in history, the Chinese people are preparing the way forward to communism:</p>
          <p id="p_000681" smilref="Capitalism_and_After__The_Ri00001.smil#p_000681">The struggle of the proletariat and the revolutionary people to change the world comprises the fulfillment of the following tasks: to change the objective world and at the same time their own subjective world--to change their cognitive ability and change the relations between the subjective and the objective world....

          <p id="p_000684" smilref="Capitalism_and_After__The_Ri00001.smil#p_000684">The seizure of the means of production by society puts an end to commodity production and therewith to the domination of the product over the producer. Anarchy in social production is replaced by conscious organisation on a planned basis. The struggle for individual existence comes to an end, and at this point, in a certain sense, man finally cuts himself off from the animal world, leaves behind him the conditions of animal existence, and enters conditions which are really human. The conditions of existence forming his environment, which hitherto have dominated him, pass at this point under his dominion and control. Now for the first time he becomes the real, conscious master of nature, because and so far as he has become master of his own social organisation. The laws of his social activity, which have hitherto confronted him as eternal, dominating laws of nature, will then be applied by him with complete understanding and hence will be dominated by him. His social organisation, which has hitherto stood in opposition to him as if arbitrarily decreed by nature and history, will then become his own voluntary act. The objective, external forces which have hitherto dominated history will then pass under the control of man himself. It is only from this point that man will with full consciousness fashion his own history; it is only from this point that the social causes set in motion by man will have, predominantly and in constantly increasing measure, the effects willed by man. It is man's leap from the realm of necessity into the realm of freedom. (AD 311.)</p>

          <p id="p_000835" smilref="Capitalism_and_After__The_Ri00001.smil#p_000835">This is a Marxist study of the Russian Revolution of 1917 and the Chinese Revolution of 1949, designed to demonstrate their unity and continuity as two successive stages in the world socialist revolution. Their common theoretical foundation is expounded by means of extensive quotations from the Marxist classics, especially the writings of Lenin and Mao Tse-tung. These enable the reader to follow the two revolutions through the minds of those who led them, and at the same time they provide him with an introduction to the basic principles of dialectical and historical materialism; for that theory can only be understood in the light of the revolutionary struggles out of which it has grown and in which it finds its fullest and clearest expression.</p>

            <span class="text" id="span_000394">Taken together, the three volumes cover the political, historical and ideological aspects of the subject. Starting from Marx's analysis of the labour-process, Lenin's theory of reflection, and Mao Tse-tung's theory of perceptual and rational knowledge, the author endeavours to show that science and art are two interdependent forms of the organisation of social energy, both rooted in the labour-process. The argument ranges over a number of interrelated problems in linguistics, psychology, anthropology, musicology and literary criticism, not to mention philosophy and history.</span>
