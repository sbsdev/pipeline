                <p>Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (commonly shortened to Alice in Wonderland) is
                    an 1865 novel written by English author Charles Lutwidge Dodgson under the
                    pseudonym Lewis Carroll. It tells of a girl named Alice falling through a rabbit
                    hole into a fantasy world populated by peculiar, anthropomorphic creatures. The
                    tale plays with logic, giving the story lasting popularity with adults as well
                    as with children. It is considered to be one of the best examples of the
                    literary nonsense genre. Its narrative course and structure, characters and
                    imagery have been enormously influential in both popular culture and literature,
                    especially in the fantasy genre.</p>

                <span>Chapter I.</span>
                <span>Down the Rabbit-Hole</span>
            </h1>
            <p>
                <span class="name">Alice</span> was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her
                sister on the bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into
                the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in it,
                    <span class="line-alice">"and what is <span id="page_2" class="page-normal"
                        epub:type="pagebreak" title="2"></span> the use of a book,"</span> thought
                    <span class="name">Alice</span>, <span class="line-alice">"without pictures or
                    conversation?"</span>
            </p>
            <p> So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the hot day made
                her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would
                be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies, when suddenly a White
                Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her. </p>
            <p>There was nothing so <em>very</em> remarkable in that; nor did <span class="name"
                    >Alice</span> think it so <em>very</em> much out of the way to hear the <span
                    class="name">Rabbit</span>say to itself, <span class="line-rabbit">"Oh dear! Oh
                    dear! I shall be late!"</span> (when she thought it over afterwards, it occurred
                to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the time it all seemed quite
                natural); but when the Rabbit actually <em>took a watch out of its
                    waistcoat-pocket</em>, and looked at it, and then hurried on, <span class="name"
                    >Alice</span> started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had
                never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take out of
                it, and, <span id="page_3" class="page-normal" epub:type="pagebreak" title="3"
                ></span> burning with curiosity, she ran across the field after it, and fortunately
                was just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge. </p>
            <p>In another moment down went <span class="name">Alice</span> after it, never once
                considering how in the world she was to get out again.</p>
            <p>The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then dipped suddenly
                down, so suddenly that <span class="name">Alice</span> had not a moment to think
                about stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very deep well. </p>
            <p> Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had plenty of time
                as she went down to look about her and to wonder what was going to happen next.
                First, she tried to look down and make out what she was coming to, but it was too
                dark to see anything; then she looked at the sides of the well, and noticed that
                they were filled with cupboards and book-shelves; here and there she saw maps and
                pictures hung upon pegs. She took down B2 <span id="page_4" class="page-normal"
                    epub:type="pagebreak" title="4"></span> a jar from one of the shelves as she
                passed; it was labelled "ORANGE MARMALADE", but to her great disappointment it was
                empty: she did not like to drop the jar for fear of killing somebody, so managed to
                put it into one of the cupboards as she fell past it. </p>
            <p><span class="line-alice">"Well!"</span> thought <span class="name">Alice</span> to
                herself, <span class="line-alice">"after such a fall as this, I shall think nothing
                    of tumbling down stairs! How brave they'll all think me at home! Why, I wouldn"t
                    say anything about it, even if I fell off the top of the house!" </span> (Which
                was very likely true.) </p>
            <p> Down, down, down. Would the fall <em>never</em> come to an end! <span
                    class="line-alice">"I wonder how many miles I've fallen by this time?"</span>
                she said aloud. <span class="line-alice">"I must be getting somewhere near the
                    centre of the earth. Let me see: that would be four thousand miles down, I
                    think—" (for, you see, <span class="name">Alice</span> had learnt several things
                    of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom, and though this was not a
                        <em>very</em> good opportunity for showing off her knowledge, as there was
                    no one to listen to <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="page-normal" id="page_5"
                        title="5"></span>her, still it was good practice to say it over) "—yes,
                    that's about the right distance—but then I wonder what Latitude or Longitude
                    I've got to?"</span> (Alice had no idea what Latitude was, or Longitude either,
                but thought they were nice grand words to say.)</p>
            <p>Presently she began again. <span class="line-alice">"I wonder if I shall fall right
                        <em>through</em> the earth! How funny it'll seem to come out among the
                    people that walk with their heads downward! The Antipathies, I think—"</span>
                (she was rather glad there <em>was</em> no one listening, this time, as it didn't
                sound at all the right word) <span class="line-alice">" —but I shall have to ask
                    them what the name of the country is, you know. Please, Ma'am, is this New
                    Zealand or Australia?"</span> (and she tried to curtsey as she spoke—fancy
                    <em>curtseying</em> as you"re falling through the air! Do you think you could
                manage it?) <span class="line-alice">"And what an ignorant little girl she'll think
                    me for asking! No, it'll never do to ask: perhaps I shall see it written up
                    somewhere."</span></p>
            <div id="page_6" class="page-normal" epub:type="pagebreak" title="6"></div>
            <p>Down, down, down. There was nothing else to do, so <span class="name">Alice</span>
                soon began talking again. <span class="line-alice">"<span class="name">Dinah</span>
                    'll miss me very much to-night, I should think!"</span> (<span class="name"
                    >Dinah</span> was the cat.) <span class="line-alice">"I hope they'll remember
                    her saucer of milk at tea-time. <span class="name">Dinah</span> my dear! I wish
                    you were down here with me! There are no mice in the air, I'm afraid, but you
                    might catch a bat, and that's very like a mouse, you know. But do cats eat bats,
                    I wonder?"</span> And here <span class="name">Alice</span> began to get rather
                sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a dreamy sort of way, <span
                    class="line-alice">"Do cats eat bats? Do cats eat bats?"</span> and sometimes,
                    <span class="line-alice">"Do bats eat cats?"</span> for, you see, as she
                couldn't answer either question, it didn't much matter which way she put it. She
                felt that she was dozing off, and had just begun to dream that she was walking hand
                in hand with <span class="name">Dinah</span>, and saying to her very earnestly,
                    <span class="line-alice">"Now, <span class="name">Dinah</span>, tell me the
                    truth: did you ever eat a bat?"</span> when suddenly, thump! thump! down she
                came upon a heap of sticks and dry leaves, and the fall was over.</p>
            <div id="page_7" class="page-normal" epub:type="pagebreak" title="7"></div>
            <p><span class="name">Alice</span> was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up on to her feet
                in a moment: she looked up, but it was all dark overhead; before her was another
                long passage, and the White Rabbit was still in sight, hurrying down it. There was
                not a moment to be lost: away went <span class="name">Alice</span> like the wind,
                and was just in time to hear it say, as it turned a corner, <span
                    class="line-rabbit">"Oh my ears and whiskers, how late it's getting!"</span> She
                was close behind it when she turned the corner, but the <span class="name"
                    >Rabbit</span>was no longer to be seen: she found herself in a long, low hall,
                which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging from the roof.</p>
            <p>There were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked; and when <span
                    class="name">Alice</span> had been all the way down one side and up the other,
                trying every door, she walked sadly down the middle, wondering how she was ever to
                get out again.</p>
            <p>Suddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of solid glass; there
                was nothing on it except a tiny golden key, and Alice's first thought was that it
                might belong to one of the <span id="page_8" class="page-normal"
                    epub:type="pagebreak" title="8"></span> doors of the hall; but, alas! either the
                locks were too large, or the key was too small, but at any rate it would not open
                any of them. However, on the second time round, she came upon a low curtain she had
                not noticed before, and behind it was a little door about fifteen inches high: she
                tried the little golden key in the lock, and to her great delight it fitted!</p>
            <img id="img_3" src="images/alice03a.jpg" alt="Alice finding tiny door behind curtain" />
            <p><span class="name">Alice</span> opened the door and found that it led into a small
                passage, not much larger than a rat-hole: she knelt down and looked along the
                passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw. How she longed to get out of that
                dark hall, and wander about among those beds of bright <span id="page_9"
                    class="page-normal" epub:type="pagebreak" title="9"></span> flowers and those
                cool fountains, but she could not even get her head though the doorway; <span
                    class="line-alice">"and even if my head would go through,"</span> thought poor
                    <span class="name">Alice</span>, <span class="line-alice">"it would be of very
                    little use without my shoulders. Oh, how I wish I could shut up like a
                    telescope! I think I could, if I only know how to begin."</span> For, you see,
                so many out-of-the-way things had happened lately, that <span class="name"
                    >Alice</span> had begun to think that very few things indeed were really
                impossible.</p>
            <p>There seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so she went back to the
                table, half hoping she might find another key on it, or at any rate a book of rules
                for shutting people up like telescopes: this time she found a little bottle on it,
                ("which certainly was not here before," said <span class="name">Alice</span>,) and
                round the neck of the bottle was a paper label, with the words "DRINK ME"
                beautifully printed on it in large letters.</p>
            <p>It was all very well to say "Drink me," but the wise little <span class="name"
                    >Alice</span> was not going to do <em>that</em>
                <span id="page_10" class="page-normal" epub:type="pagebreak" title="10"></span>in a
                hurry. <span class="line-alice">"No, I'll look first,"</span> she said, <span
                    class="line-alice">"and see whether it’s marked 'poison' or not:"</span> for she
                had read several nice little histories about children who had got burnt, and eaten
                up by wild beasts and other unpleasant things, all because they <em>would</em> not
                remember the simple rules their friends had taught them: such as, that a red-hot
                poker will burn you if you hold it too long; and that if you cut your finger
                    <em>very</em> deeply with a knife, it usually bleeds; and she had never
                forgotten that, if you drink much from a bottle marked "poison," it is almost
                certain to disagree with you, sooner or later.</p>
            <img id="img_4" src="images/alice04a.jpg" alt="Alice taking “Drink Me” bottle" />
            <p>However, this bottle was <em>not</em> marked "poison," <span epub:type="pagebreak"
                    class="page-normal" id="page_11" title="11"></span> so <span class="name"
                    >Alice</span> ventured to taste it, and finding it very nice, (it had, in fact,
                a sort of mixed flavour of cherry-tart, custard, pine-apple, roast turkey, toffee,
                and hot buttered toast,) she very soon finished it off.</p>


            <p><span class="line-alice">"What a curious feeling!"</span> said <span class="name"
                    >Alice</span>, <span class="line-alice">"I must be shutting up like a
                    telescope."</span></p>
            <p>And so it was indeed: she was now only ten inches high, and her face brightened up at
                the thought that she was now the right size for going through the little door into
                that lovely garden. First, however, she waited for a few minutes to see if she was
                going to shrink any further: she felt a little nervous about this; <span
                    class="line-alice">"for it might end, you know,"</span> said <span class="name"
                    >Alice</span> to herself, <span class="line-alice">"in my going out altogether,
                    like a candle. I wonder what I should be like then?"</span> And she tried to
                fancy what the flame of a candle is like after the candle is blown out, <span
                    id="page_12" class="page-normal" epub:type="pagebreak" title="12"></span> for
                she could not remember ever having seen such a thing.</p>
            <p>After a while, finding that nothing more happened, she decided on going into the
                garden at once; but, alas for poor Alice! when she got to the door, she found she
                had forgotten the little golden key, and when she went back to the table for it, she
                found she could not possibly reach it: she could see it quite plainly through the
                glass, and she tried her best to climb up one of the legs of the table, but it was
                too slippery; and when she had tired herself out with trying, the poor little thing
                sat down and cried.</p>
            <p><span class="line-alice">"Come, there’s no use in crying like that!"</span> said
                    <span class="name">Alice</span> to herself, rather sharply; <span
                    class="line-alice">"I advise you to leave off this minute!"</span> She generally
                gave herself very good advice, (though she very seldom followed it,) and sometimes
                she scolded herself so severely as to bring tears into her eyes; and once she
                remembered trying to box her own ears for having cheated herself <span
                    epub:type="pagebreak" class="page-normal" id="p13" title="13"></span> in a game
                of croquet she was playing against herself, for this curious child was very fond of
                pretending to be two people. <span class="line-alice">"But it’s no use now,"</span>
                thought poor <span class="name">Alice</span>, <span class="line-alice">"to pretend
                    to be two people! Why, there's hardly enough of me left to make <em>one</em>
                    respectable person!"</span></p>
            <p>Soon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under the table: she opened
                it, and found in it a very small cake, on which the words "EAT ME" were beautifully
                marked in currants. <span class="line-alice">"Well, I’ll eat it,"</span> said <span
                    class="name">Alice</span>, <span class="line-alice">"and if it makes me grow
                    larger, I can reach the key; and if it makes me grow smaller, I can creep under
                    the door; so either way I’ll get into the garden, and I don’t care which
                    happens!"</span></p>
            <p>She ate a little bit, and said anxiously to herself, <span class="line-alice">‘Which
                    way? Which way?’</span>, holding her hand on the top of her head to feel which
                way it was growing, and she was quite surprised to find that she remained the same
                size: to be sure, this generally happens when one eats cake, but <span class="name"
                    >Alice</span> had got so much into the <span epub:type="pagebreak"
                    class="page-normal" id="p14" title="14"></span> way of expecting nothing but
                out-of-the-way things to happen, that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go
                on in the common way.</p>
            <p>So she set to work, and very soon finished off the cake.</p>

            <p>The Pool of Tears</p>
            <img id="img_5" src="images/alice05a.jpg" alt="Alice stretched tall" />
            <p>"Curiouser and curiouser!" cried <span class="name">Alice</span> (she was so much
                surprised, that for the moment she quite forgot how to speak good English); "now I'm
                opening out like the largest telescope that ever was! Good-bye, feet!" (for when she
                looked down at her feet, they seemed to be almost out of sight, they were getting so
                far off). "Oh, my poor little feet, I wonder <span epub:type="pagebreak"
                    class="page-normal" title="16" id="p16"></span>who will put on your shoes and
                stockings for you now, dears? I'm sure <em>I</em> shan't be able! I shall be a great
                deal too far off to trouble myself about you: you must manage the best way you can;
                -but I must be kind to them," thought <span class="name">Alice</span>, "or perhaps
                they won't walk the way I want to go! Let me see: I'll give them a new pair of boots
                every Christmas."</p>

            <p>And she went on planning to herself how she would manage it. "They must go by the
                carrier," she thought; "and how funny it'll seem, sending presents to one's own
                feet! And how odd the directions will look!</p>
            <div xml:space="preserve" class="letter">
                    <p class="line">Alice's Right Foot, Esq.</p>

                </div>
            <p>Oh dear, what nonsense I'm talking!"</p>
            <p>Just then her head struck against the roof of the hall: in fact she was now more than
                nine feet high, and she at once took up the little golden key and hurried off to the
                garden door.</p>
            <div epub:type="pagebreak" class="page-normal" id="p17" title="17"></div>
            <p>Poor Alice! It was as much as she could do, lying down on one side, to look through
                into the garden with one eye; but to get through was more hopeless than ever: she
                sat down and began to cry again.</p>
            <p>"You ought to be ashamed of yourself," said <span class="name">Alice</span>, "a great
                girl like you," (she might well say this), "to go on crying in this way! Stop this
                moment, I tell you!" But she went on all the same, shedding gallons of tears, until
                there was a large pool all round her, about four inches deep and reaching half down
                the hall.</p>
            <p>After a time she heard a little pattering of feet in the distance, and she hastily
                dried her eyes to see what was coming. It was the White Rabbit returning, splendidly
                dressed, with a pair of white kid gloves in one hand and a large fan in the other:
                he came trotting along in a great hurry, muttering to himself as he came, "Oh! the
                Duchess, the Duchess! Oh! won't she be savage if I've kept her waiting!" <span
                    class="name">Alice</span> felt so desperate that she was ready to ask help <span
                    epub:type="pagebreak" class="page-normal" id="p18" title="18"></span> of any
                one; so, when the <span class="name">Rabbit</span>came near her, she began, in a
                low, timid voice, "If you please, sir-" The Rabbit started violently, dropped the
                white kid gloves and the fan, and skurried away into the darkness as hard as he
                could go.</p>
            <img id="img_6" src="images/alice06a.jpg" alt="Giant Alice watching Rabbit run away" />
            <div epub:type="pagebreak" class="page-normal" id="p19" title="19"></div>
            <p><span class="name">Alice</span> took up the fan and gloves, and, as the hall was very
                hot, she kept fanning herself all the time she went on talking: "Dear, dear! How
                queer everything is to-day! And yesterday things went on just as usual. I wonder if
                I've been changed in the night? Let me think: was I the same when I got up this
                morning? I almost think I can remember feeling a little different. But if I'm not
                the same, the next question is, Who in the world am I? Ah, <em>that's</em> the great
                puzzle!" And she began thinking over all the children she knew that were of the same
                age as herself, to see if she could have been changed for any of them.</p>
            <p>"I'm sure I'm not Ada," she said, "for her hair goes in such long ringlets, and mine
                doesn't go in ringlets at all; and I'm sure I can't be Mabel, for I know all sorts
                of things, and she, oh! she knows such a very little! Besides, <em>she's</em> she,
                and I'm I, and-oh dear, how puzzling it all is! I'll try if I know all the things I
                used to know. Let me see: four times five is twelve, <span epub:type="pagebreak"
                    class="page-normal" title="20" id="p20"></span> and four times six is thirteen,
                and four times seven is-oh dear! I shall never get to twenty at that rate! However,
                the Multiplication Table doesn't signify: let's try Geography. London is the capital
                of Paris, and Paris is the capital of Rome, and Rome-no, <em>that's</em> all wrong,
                I'm certain! I must have been changed for Mabel! I'll try and say "How doth the
                little-'" and she crossed her hands on her lap as if she were saying lessons, and
                began to repeat it, but her voice sounded hoarse and strange, and the words did not
                come the same as they used to do:-</p>

            <p>"I'm sure those are not the right words," said poor <span class="name">Alice</span>,
                and her eyes filled with tears again as she went on, "I must be Mabel after all, and
                I shall have to go and live in that poky little house, and have next to no toys to
                play with, and oh! ever so many lessons to learn! No, I've made up my mind about it;
                if I'm Mabel, I'll stay down here! It'll be no use their putting their heads down
                and saying "Come up again, dear!" I shall only look up and say "Who am I then? Tell
                me that first, and then, if I like being that person, I'll come up: if not, I'll
                stay down here till I'm somebody else' -but, oh dear!" cried <span class="name"
                    >Alice</span>, with a sudden burst of tears, "I do wish they <em>would</em> put
                their heads down! I am so <em>very</em> tired of being all alone here!"</p>
            <p>As she said this she looked down at her hands, and was surprised to see that she had
                put on one of the Rabbit's little white kid gloves while she was talking. "How
                    <em>can</em> I have done that?" she thought. "I must be growing small<span
                    epub:type="pagebreak" class="page-normal" title="22" id="p22"></span> again."
                She got up and went to the table to measure herself by it, and found that, as nearly
                as she could guess, she was now about two feet high, and was going on shrinking
                rapidly: she soon found out that the cause of this was the fan she was holding, and
                she dropped it hastily, just in time to avoid shrinking away altogether.</p>
            <p>"That <em>was</em> a narrow escape!" said <span class="name">Alice</span>, a good
                deal frightened at the sudden change, but very glad to find herself still in
                existence; "and now for the garden!" and she ran with all speed back to the little
                door: but, alas! the little door was shut again, and the little golden key was lying
                on the glass table as before, "and things are worse than ever," thought the poor
                child, "for I never was so small as this before, never! And I declare it's too bad,
                that it is!"</p>
            <p>As she said these words her foot slipped, and in another moment, splash! she was up
                to her chin in salt water. Her first idea was that she had somehow fallen into the
                sea, "and in <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="page-normal" id="p23" title="23"
                ></span>that case I can go back by railway," she said to herself. (Alice had been to
                the seaside once in her life, and had come to the general conclusion, that wherever
                you go to on the English coast you find a number of bathing machines in the sea,
                some children digging in the sand with wooden spades, then a row of lodging houses,
                and behind them a railway station.) However, she soon made out that she was in the
                pool of tears which she had wept when she was nine feet high.</p>
            <img id="img_7" src="images/alice07a.jpg" alt="Alice in pool of tears" />
            <p>"I wish I hadn't cried so much!" said <span class="name">Alice</span>, as she swam
                about, trying to find her way out.<span epub:type="pagebreak" class="page-normal"
                    id="p24" title="24"></span> "I shall be punished for it now, I suppose, by being
                drowned in my own tears! That <em>will</em> be a queer thing, to be sure! However,
                everything is queer to-day."</p>
            <p>Just then she heard something splashing about in the pool a little way off, and she
                swam nearer to make out what it was: at first she thought it must be a walrus or
                hippopotamus, but then she remembered how small she was now, and she soon made out
                that it was only a mouse that had slipped in like herself.</p>
            <p>"Would it be of any use, now," thought <span class="name">Alice</span>, "to speak to
                this mouse? Everything is so out-of-the-way down here, that I should think very
                likely it can talk: at any rate, there's no harm in trying." So she began: "O Mouse,
                do you know the way out of this pool? I am very tired of swimming about here, O
                Mouse!" (Alice thought this must be the right way of speaking to a mouse: she had
                never done such a thing before, but she remembered having seen in her brother's
                Latin Grammar, "A mouse- <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="page-normal" id="p25"
                    title="25"></span>of a mouse-to a mouse-a mouse-O mouse!" The Mouse looked at
                her rather inquisitively, and seemed to her to wink with one of its little eyes, but
                it said nothing.</p>

            <p><span class="line-alice">"Perhaps it doesn't understand English,"</span> thought
                Alice; <span class="line-alice">"I daresay it's a French mouse, come over with
                    William the Conqueror."</span> (For, with all her knowledge of history, <span
                    class="name">Alice</span> had no very clear notion how long ago anything had
                happened.) So she began again: <span class="line-alice">"Ou est ma chatte?"</span>
                which was the first sentence in her French lesson-book. The <span class="name"
                    >Mouse</span>gave a sudden leap out of the water, and seemed to quiver all over
                with fright. <span class="line-alice">"Oh, I beg your pardon!"</span> cried <span
                    class="name">Alice</span> hastily, afraid that she had hurt the poor animal's
                feelings. <span class="line-alice">"I quite forgot you didn't like cats."</span></p>

            <p><span class="line-mouse">"Not like cats!"</span> cried the Mouse, in a shrill,
                passionate voice. <span class="line-mouse">"Would <em>you</em> like cats if you were
                    me?"</span></p>
            <p><span class="line-mouse">"Well, perhaps not,"</span> said <span class="name"
                    >Alice</span> in a soothing tone: <span class="line-mouse">"don't be angry about
                    it. And yet <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="page-normal" title="26" id="p26"
                    ></span>I wish I could show you our cat <span class="name">Dinah</span>: I think
                    you'd take a fancy to cats if you could only see her. She is such a dear quiet
                    thing,"</span>
                <span class="name">Alice</span> went on, half to herself, as she swam lazily <img
                    id="img_8" src="images/alice08a.jpg" alt="Alice with Mouse in pool of tears" />
                about in the pool, <span class="line-mouse">"and she sits purring so nicely by the
                    fire, licking her paws and washing her face-and she is such a nice soft thing to
                    nurse-and she's such a capital one for catching mice-oh, I beg your
                    pardon!"</span> cried <span class="name">Alice</span> again, for this time the
                    <span class="name">Mouse</span>was bristling all over, and she felt certain it
                must be really <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="page-normal" id="p27" title="27"
                ></span> offended. <span class="line-mouse">"We won't talk about her any more if
                    you'd rather not."</span></p>

            <p><span class="line-mouse">"We indeed!"</span> cried the Mouse, who was trembling down
                to the end of his tail. <span class="line-mouse">"As if I would talk on such a
                    subject! Our family always <em>hated</em> cats: nasty, low, vulgar things! Don't
                    let me hear the name again!"</span></p>

            <p>"I won't indeed!" said <span class="name">Alice</span>, in a great hurry to change
                the subject of conversation. "Are you-are you fond-of-of dogs?" The <span
                    class="name">Mouse</span>did not answer, so <span class="name">Alice</span> went
                on eagerly: "There is such a nice little dog near our house I should like to show
                you! A little bright-eyed terrier, you know, with oh, such long curly brown hair!
                And it'll fetch things when you throw them, and it'll sit up and beg for its dinner,
                and all sorts of things-I can't remember half of them-and it belongs to a farmer,
                you know, and he says it's so useful, it's worth a hundred pounds! He says it kills
                all the rats and-oh dear!" cried Alice in a sorrowful tone, "I'm afraid I've
                offended it <span id="page_28" class="page-normal" epub:type="pagebreak" title="28"
                ></span> again!" For the <span class="name">Mouse</span>was swimming away from her
                as hard as it could go, and making quite a commotion in the pool as it went.</p>
            <p>So she called softly after it, "Mouse dear! Do come back again, and we won't talk
                about cats or dogs either, if you don't like them!" When the <span class="name"
                    >Mouse</span>heard this, it turned round and swam slowly back to her: its face
                was quite pale (with passion, <span class="name">Alice</span> thought), and it said
                in a low trembling voice, "Let us get to the shore, and then I'll tell you my
                history, and you'll understand why it is I hate cats and dogs."</p>

            <p>It was high time to go, for the pool was getting quite crowded with the birds and
                animals that had fallen into it: there were a Duck and a Dodo, a Lory and an Eaglet,
                and several other curious creatures. <span class="name">Alice</span> led the way,
                and the whole party swam to the shore.</p>

            <h1 id="chapter_3">CHAPTER III</h1>
            <p>A Caucus-Race and a Long Tale</p>
            <img id="img_9" src="images/alice10a.jpg" alt="Mouse telling story to birds and Alice" />
            <p>They were indeed a queer-looking party that assembled on the bank-the birds with
                draggled feathers, the animals with their fur clinging close to them, and all
                dripping wet, cross, and uncomfortable.</p>
            <p>The first question of course was, how to get dry again: they had a consultation about
                this, <span id="page_30" class="page-normal" epub:type="pagebreak" title="30"
                ></span> and after a few minutes it seemed quite natural to <span class="name"
                    >Alice</span> to find herself talking familiarly with them, as if she had known
                them all her life. Indeed, she had quite a long argument with the Lory, who at last
                turned sulky, and would only say, "I am older than you, and must know better;" and
                this <span class="name">Alice</span> would not allow without knowing how old it was,
                and, as the Lory positively refused to tell its age, there was no more to be
                said.</p>
            <p>At last the Mouse, who seemed to be a person of authority among them, called out,
                "Sit down, all of you, and listen to me! <em>I'll</em> soon make you dry enough!"
                They all sat down at once, in a large ring, with the <span class="name"
                >Mouse</span>in the middle. <span class="name">Alice</span> kept her eyes anxiously
                fixed on it, for she felt sure she would catch a bad cold if she did not get dry
                very soon.</p>

            <p>"Ahem!" said the <span class="name">Mouse</span>with an important air, "are you all
                ready? This is the driest thing I know. Silence all round, if you please! '<span
                    class="name">William the Conqueror</span>, whose cause was <span

                of late much accustomed to usurpation and conquest. <span class="name">Edwin</span>
                and <span class="name">Morcar</span>, the earls of Mercia and Northumbria-'"</p>
            <p>"Ugh!" said the Lory, with a shiver.</p>
            <p>"I beg your pardon?" said the Mouse, frowning, but very politely: "Did you
                speak?"</p>
            <p>"Not I!" said the Lory hastily.</p>

            <p>"I thought you did," said the Mouse. -"I proceed. '<span class="name">Edwin</span>
                and <span class="name">Morcar</span>, the earls of <span class="name place"
                    >Mercia</span> and <span class="name place">Northumbria</span>, declared for
                him: and even <span class="name">Stigand</span>, the patriotic archbishop of
                Canterbury, found it advisable-'"</p>
            <p>"Found <em>what</em>?" said the Duck.</p>
            <p>"Found <em>it</em>," the Mouse replied rather crossly: "of course you know what 'it'
                means."</p>
            <p>"I know what 'it' means well enough, when I find a thing," said the Duck: "it's
                generally a frog or a worm. The question is, what did the archbishop find?"</p>
            <p>The <span class="name">Mouse</span>did not notice this question, but <span
                    epub:type="pagebreak" class="page-normal" title="32" id="p32"></span> hurriedly
                went on, "'-found it advisable to go with Edgar Atheling to meet William and offer
                him the crown. William's conduct at first was moderate. But the insolence of his
                Normans-' How are you getting on now, my dear?" it continued, turning to <span
                    class="name">Alice</span> as it spoke.</p>
            <p>"As wet as ever," said <span class="name">Alice</span> in a melancholy tone: "it
                doesn't seem to dry me at all."</p>
            <p>"In that case," said the Dodo solemnly, rising to its feet, "I move that the meeting
                adjourn, for the immediate adoption of more energetic remedies-"</p>
            <p>"Speak English!" said the Eaglet. "I don't know the meaning of half those long words,
                and, what's more, I don't believe you do either!" And the Eaglet bent down its head
                to hide a smile: some of the other birds tittered audibly.</p>

            <p>"What I was going to say," said the Dodo in an offended tone, "was, that the best
                thing to get us dry would be a Caucus-race."</p>
            <p>"What <em>is</em> a Caucus-race?" said Alice; not that she wanted much to know, but
                the Dodo <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="page-normal" id="p33" title="33"></span>
                had paused as if it thought that <em>somebody</em> ought to speak, and no one else
                seemed inclined to say anything.</p>
            <p>"Why," said the Dodo, "the best way to explain it is to do it." (And, as you might
                like to try the thing yourself, some winter day, I will tell you how the Dodo
                managed it.)</p>

            <p>First it marked out a race-course, in a sort of circle, ("the exact shape doesn't
                matter," it said,) and then all the party were placed along the course, here and
                there. There was no "One, two, three, and away," but they began running when they
                liked, and left off when they liked, so that it was not easy to know when the race
                was over. However, when they had been running half an hour or so, and were quite dry
                again, the Dodo suddenly called out "The race is over!" and they all crowded round
                it, panting, and asking, "But who has won?"</p>
            <p>This question the Dodo could not answer without a great deal of thought, and it sat
                for a long time with one finger pressed upon its <span epub:type="pagebreak"
                    class="page-normal" title="34" id="p34"></span> forehead (the position in which
                you usually see Shakespeare, in the pictures of him), while the rest waited in
                silence. At last the Dodo said, "<em>everybody</em> has won, and all must have
                prizes."</p>

            <p>"But who is to give the prizes?" quite a chorus of voices asked.</p>
            <p>"Why, <em>she</em>, of course," said the Dodo, pointing to <span class="name"
                    >Alice</span> with one finger; and the whole party at once crowded round her,
                calling out in a confused way, "Prizes! Prizes!"</p>
            <p><span class="name">Alice</span> had no idea what to do, and in despair she put her
                hand in her pocket, and pulled out a box of comfits, (luckily the salt water had not
                got into it), and handed them round as prizes. There was exactly one a-piece all
                round.</p>
            <p>"But she must have a prize herself, you know," said the Mouse.</p>

            <p>"Of course," the Dodo replied very gravely. "What else have you got in your pocket?"
                he went on, turning to Alice.</p>
            <p>"Only a thimble," said <span class="name">Alice</span> sadly.</p>
            <p>"Hand it over here," said the Dodo.</p>
            <div epub:type="pagebreak" class="page-normal" id="p35" title="35"></div>
            <img id="img_10" src="images/alice09a.jpg" alt="Dodo presenting thimble" />
            <p>Then they all crowded round her once more, while the Dodo solemnly presented the
                thimble, saying "We beg your acceptance of this elegant thimble;" and, when it had
                finished this short speech, they all cheered.</p>
            <div epub:type="pagebreak" class="page-normal" id="p36" title="36"></div>
            <p><span class="name">Alice</span> thought the whole thing very absurd, but they all
                looked so grave that she did not dare to laugh; and, as she could not think of
                anything to say, she simply bowed, and took the thimble, looking as solemn as she
                could.</p>
            <p>The next thing was to eat the comfits: this caused some noise and confusion, as the
                large birds complained that they could not taste theirs, and the small ones choked
                and had to be patted on the back. However, it was over at last, and they sat down
                again in a ring, and begged the <span class="name">Mouse</span>to tell them

            <p>"Mine is a long and a sad tale!" said the Mouse, turning to <span class="name"

            <p>"You are not attending!" said the <span class="name">Mouse</span>to <span
                    class="name">Alice</span> severely. "What are you thinking of?"</p>
            <p>"I beg your pardon," said <span class="name">Alice</span> very humbly: "you had got
                to the fifth bend, I think?"</p>
            <p>"I had <em>not</em>!" cried the Mouse, sharply and very angrily.</p>
            <p>"A knot!" said <span class="name">Alice</span>, always ready to make herself useful,
                and looking anxiously about her. "Oh, do let me help to undo it!"</p>
            <p>"I shall do nothing of the sort," said the Mouse, getting up and walking away. "You
                insult me by talking such nonsense!"</p>
            <p>"I didn't mean it!" pleaded poor Alice. "But you're so easily offended, you
                know!"</p>

            <p>The <span class="name">Mouse</span>only growled in reply.</p>
            <p>"Please come back and finish your story!" <span class="name">Alice</span> called
                after it; and the others all joined in chorus, "Yes, please do!" but the <span
                    class="name">Mouse</span>only shook its head impatiently, and walked a little
                quicker.</p>
            <p>"What a pity it wouldn't stay!" sighed the Lory, as soon as it was quite out of
                sight; <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="page-normal" id="p39" title="39"></span>
                and an old Crab took the opportunity of saying to her daughter "Ah, my dear! Let
                this be a lesson to you never to lose <em>your</em> temper!" "Hold your tongue, Ma!"
                said the young Crab, a little snappishly. "You're enough to try the patience of an
                oyster!"</p>
            <p>"I wish I had our <span class="name">Dinah</span> here, I know I do!" said <span
                    class="name">Alice</span> aloud, addressing nobody in particular. "She'd soon
                fetch it back!"</p>
            <p>"And who is <span class="name">Dinah</span>, if I might venture to ask the question?"
                said the Lory.</p>
            <p><span class="name">Alice</span> replied eagerly, for she was always ready to talk
                about her pet: "<span class="name">Dinah</span>'s our cat. And she's such a capital
                one for catching mice you can't think! And oh, I wish you could see her after the
                birds! Why, she'll eat a little bird as soon as look at it!"</p>
            <p>This speech caused a remarkable sensation among the party. Some of the birds hurried
                off at once: one old Magpie began wrapping itself up very carefully, remarking, "I
                really must be getting home; the night-air doesn't <span epub:type="pagebreak"
                    class="page-normal" title="40" id="p40"></span> suit my throat!" and a Canary
                called out in a trembling voice to its children, "Come away, my dears! It's high
                time you were all in bed!" On various pretexts they all moved off, and <span
                    class="name">Alice</span> was soon left alone.</p>
            <p>"I wish I hadn't mentioned <span class="name">Dinah</span>!" she said to herself in a
                melancholy tone. "Nobody seems to like her, down here, and I'm sure she's the best
                cat in the world! Oh, my dear <span class="name">Dinah</span>! I wonder if I shall
                ever see you any more!" And here poor <span class="name">Alice</span> began to cry
                again, for she felt very lonely and low-spirited. In a little while, however, she
                again heard a little pattering of footsteps in the distance, and she looked up
                eagerly, half hoping that the <span class="name">Mouse</span>had changed his mind,
                and was coming back to finish his story.</p>
